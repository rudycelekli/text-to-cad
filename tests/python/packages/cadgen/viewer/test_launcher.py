"""The launcher contract: launch is unconditional (roll + keyed reuse, ``--new``
escape), explicit ``--port`` stays strict, and the stdout lines agents parse.

Ported from ``main.test.mjs``, and deliberately still SUBPROCESS tests rather
than in-process ones. The subject here IS the process: stdout flushing on a
server that never exits, the exit codes, signal shutdown, and the registry file
another process reads. Calling ``main()`` in-process would test none of that and
would silently pass the buffering bug that hangs the real launch.

Every launch redirects TMPDIR so the registry is private — the real one is
shared with the viewer the developer is using, and reuse and reaping are both
destructive.
