# CAD app (MCP Apps)

The page an agent host renders for CAD: the same `@text-to-cad/ui` FileViewer and
renderers `apps/web` composes, behind a different host — an MCP Apps bridge
instead of an HTTP origin. Its server is `cadgen mcp`
(`packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/mcp`).

Hosts present it in one of two ways, which the server tells apart at
`initialize` (Codex names itself `codex-mcp-client`; any other host can declare
the `dev.texttocad/tabs` extension with the `global`, `thread` and `file`
entrypoints; an MCP Apps host advertises the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`
extension):

- **Tabs (Codex, and hosts that declare those entrypoints).** **CAD** in the
  sidebar (the home: the models opened before, and Open), a **CAD** tab beside
  each thread, and *Open with CAD* for a model file. The agent opens a tab once
  (`cad_open`) and drives it (`cad_show`). A host that declares tabs does what
  Codex does: it starts one `cadgen mcp` process per thread, since a call that
  names no view reaches the thread's own tab, and it says which folder the
  thread works in, through MCP roots or Codex's per-call sandbox metadata.
- **Inline (Claude Desktop, and every other MCP Apps host).** Each `cad_show`
  mounts a viewer card in the chat, and the host keeps the old cards. A card
  shows the model alone (a compact viewer: no tools, view actions, cube or Quick
  Edit), goes full size on request, and a newer card retires the older ones.
  Full size is the whole viewer, Quick Edit included.

A client that renders no MCP Apps never loads this page: its `cad_show` answers
with the model's link in the CAD Viewer, started or reused for its folder
(`cadgen/mcp/browser.py`), and opens no browser. `CADGEN_MCP_PRESENTATION=inline`
tells the server that a client renders apps without advertising them, as the
reference host `basic-host` does.

## The rules

- **One page, told what to show.** Every surface loads this one page. The tool
  that opened it returns a *launch* — `page` (`home` or `viewer`), `model`,
  `root`, `explore` — and the page renders it: the shared CAD viewer over the
  launch's root, showing its model, or the home. Every launch names a root, the
  home's included. The server computes the root from the workspace; the page never
  guesses where it is, and nothing here branches on a surface's name (`surface` is
  only reported back to the server).
- **A launch is enough to start.** It also carries what the server is — its
  `protocol`, `version` and `platform` — and the home's carries its `recents`,
  so the page asks nothing before it draws. A tab restored from an older build
  is launched again by today's server; one that still disagrees says so.
- **Only the sidebar has a home.** `cad_home` is its one launch with `page: home`:
  the library, and Open with the desktop's chooser. A model opened from it gets a
  back arrow to it in place of an explorer. Every other surface is about files a
  thread or chat shows, and has no home: with nothing shown yet it says "Ask the
  agent to show a model".
- **Only a project is browsed.** A model in the thread's project (Codex's
  workspace, or the roots a host lists) browses that project's catalog:
  `workspace`, with `explore`. A model with no project around it — opened from the
  home, or outside the workspace — is shown on its own: a `global` root at `/` or
  its drive, whose catalog holds only the file on screen (a hidden folder it is in
  included) and which nothing lists. *Open with CAD* and an inline card show one
  file and have no explorer either.
- **An agent reaches the sidebar too.** Codex runs the sidebar page in a thread, and a server
  process, of its own, so no thread's agent syncs with it. Each process publishes its sidebar
  views beside the model library (`cadgen/mcp/sidebar_views.py`), and an agent's `cad_show`,
  `cad_view` and `cad_screenshot` mean the view a person touched last of its thread's tabs and
  the sidebar's: a model already in the sidebar is shown there, not in a new tab. Only sidebar
  views are shared; a thread's tabs are that conversation's.
- **One request to the network: analytics, with consent.** There is no update
  button: the host updates CAD (a plugin directory by itself, an unpinned `uvx` on
  restart), and GitHub's newest release often runs ahead of what a directory
  serves. The server notes its use -- tool calls (not the page's plumbing),
  view activity from each view's sync (`focused`), and the files views show,
  as salted one-way codes -- and, only with consent, sends it to
  `api.texttocad.dev` once a minute
  (`cadgen/analytics.py`; the receiver is the docs site's `/v1`): never a path, an argument
  or a file. Every install is asked once by the page (`cad_consent`, the
  shared `ConsentCard` from `@text-to-cad/ui/consent`, the viewer's `notice`: top-right
  once a model is on screen, Quick Edit under it, never on the home; the browser
  viewer asks the same way, and one answer counts for both), and nothing is sent before a yes; Settings' Analytics
  section (`appSettings`) changes the answer later. Settings' Features (Quick edit, on until
  the person turns it off) is read and changed the same way, through `cad_features`, and kept
  beside the analytics answer (`cadgen/features.py`): one choice for the sidebar, every
  thread's tab, every inline card and the browser viewer. A plugin directory's install
  (`cadgen mcp --install store`, stamped by `scripts/release/plugin_zip.py`) is
  only reported as such. The agent's `cad_analytics` reports the setting and
  turns it off, never on.
- **Told how it is presented, before it greets the host.** A host that mounts
  views inline is served the page with `<meta name="cad-presentation"
  content="inline">` in its head: the page offers that host `inline` and
  `fullscreen`. A tab host is served the file's bytes and offered `fullscreen`,
  as before inline hosts existed. `test_codex_contract` pins what Codex is
  served; supporting another host must not change it.
- **Inline views are named and ordered by the server.** Each inline launch
  carries `view` (the token the agent passes to `cad_view` and `cad_screenshot`:
  one process may serve many chats, and no host says which) and `order`
  (`{createdAt, seq}`). The views of a chat elect the newest over a
  `BroadcastChannel`. The others keep a still of their last frame, stop polling,
  stop sending context, and tell the server they are closed.
- **Quick Edit offers only what the chat takes.** `chatReach` reads the
  `hostCapabilities` the host answers `ui/initialize` with. **Queue** (the
  context for the person's next message, `ui/update-model-context`) needs
  `updateModelContext`; a tab host is not asked: Codex forwards the method
  whether or not its frame declares it. **Send** (the person's message now,
  `ui/message`) needs `message`, and carries a sketch as an image block only
  where the host declares `message.image`; a host that declares it and still
  refuses one (JSON-RPC -32602) gets the sketch saved and named by path
  instead. A host that takes neither gets Copy Prompt alone
  (`unavailablePromptContext`): Queue and Send are left out, not disabled. In
  Codex, Send from a thread's CAD tab posts into that thread; from the
  sidebar page it goes to the page's own chat tab.
- **Host-neutral shared code.** Host specifics live here and in `cadgen/mcp`,
  never in `packages/core` or `packages/ui`, which choose by capability (the
  prompt destination's `kind`, a port's presence, `environment.compact`). A policy
  test enforces it: `tests/python/global/test_host_neutral_packages.py`.
- **The web client's data path, unchanged.** `createCadClient` gets a `fetch`
  that sends each request as a `cad_http` tool call against the placeholder
  origin `http://cad.invalid`; the server hands it to the viewer's own router.
  The fetch is a distinct function, so workers are handed bytes rather than URLs.
- **No reply a host cannot read.** A reply is one JSON-RPC message, its body
  base64 (4/3 of its size), and a host that caps one message closes the
  connection past the cap, ending the server and every view on it: the MCP
  TypeScript SDK's stdio reader caps it at 10 MiB unless a host sets more
  (Claude Code 16 MiB, Claude Desktop 32 MiB). So no `cad_http` reply carries
  more than 4 MiB of body (`TUNNEL_REPLY_MAX_BYTES`), a message under 5.6 MB,
  for any model: the client asks for batched reads of at most that (the web
  client asks for 32 MiB), every GET asks for its first 4 MiB as a byte range,
  and a longer body comes back a range at a time, which the tunnel puts together
  for the client. A part of a body that changed meanwhile (its `etag`) fails the
  read, and the cache verifies a tessellation's digest of the whole as of any
  body. The server refuses any reply still longer (502), and an agent's
  screenshot longer than that, rather than send it. 4 MiB loads as fast as 8 MiB
  did.
- **One file.** The build inlines scripts, styles, workers (as blobs) and the
  drawing editor's fonts (as data URIs) into `dist/index.html`, and fails if
  anything would be left outside it: the host serves one resource and nothing
  beside it. Its scripts are still split where the app imports lazily (each
  renderer, the drawing editor and its libraries): each chunk is a gzip'd string
  that becomes a blob module only when something imports it, so a view parses
  what it shows rather than all of the app (`vite.config.mjs`).
- **Nothing waits unseen.** While the home's list is read, placeholder cards (or
  rows) stand where the models will be; a model being opened shows a spinner over
  its picture, and takes no second press, until the launch switches to the
  viewer, whose own progress takes over.
- **Nothing is held open, and a view makes one call a second.** A host relays
  every call its views make through a few slots they all share, and holds a call
  until one frees: a call held open by one view queues every model load, picture
  and pick of the others behind it. So a view syncs (`cad_sync`, `host/sync.ts`),
  answered at once, about once a second (`views.POLL_SECONDS`). Up go what it
  shows — its model, its state whenever that changed (what `cad_view` reads),
  that a person just touched it — and what it watches: its root's catalog and
  the build feed of a model being edited. Back come the agent's requests for it
  (`show`, `capture`), the catalog's revision, which the view reads again only
  when it moved, and each feed's status (whether a build is running or failed:
  the view shows the saved file), handed to the client as its
  `editingPreviewFeed`. A sync that brought news (an event, a moving build) is
  followed by the next sooner.

## Host adapter (`src/host`)

| Module | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bridge.ts` | JSON-RPC 2.0 over `postMessage`: requests, the opening tool's result, host context, teardown |
| `server.ts` | typed calls to the server's tools, `cad_reveal` among them: the file menu's Reveal, in the desktop's file manager (the server is on the person's machine) |
| `tunnel.ts` | the `fetch` over `cad_http`, a long body a range at a time |
| `files.ts` | a filesystem's read-only `FileSource`: the file on screen, never listed, whose copied references name files by absolute path (a project's is `@text-to-cad/ui/catalog`'s, as the web Viewer's is) |
| `prompt.ts` | Quick Edit's chat: `chatReach`, what the host's chat takes, and the prompt port over it — Queue through `ui/update-model-context` (a text block titled `Quick edit · <file>` and the sketch's image block, kept until the host clears its model context), Send through `ui/message` — with references as absolute paths (Copy Prompt spells them as copied references are) |
| `live.ts`, `sync.ts` | the mounted view's live controller (`@text-to-cad/ui/host`'s registry), and its sync (`cad_sync`), every second: its state for the agent, the agent's requests (`show`, `capture`), the catalog's revision and its build feeds |
| `presentation.ts` | how the host presents the page, and the election that retires older inline views |

`ModelView.tsx` is the page: the shared `CadViewer` (`@text-to-cad/ui/cad-viewer`,
the one the web Viewer shows) over one launch's root, with this host's ports — its
tunnel (which also carries a copied prompt's sketch to the server: `attachments`), its
chat, its file menu (copy path, copy relative path under a project,
Reveal through `cad_reveal`), the navbar's and Settings' links (Settings' Feedback and an
alert's Report Issue open a new issue), followed through `ui/open-link`,
and, on the sidebar, its library, with Open: the desktop's file chooser, where any file can be chosen.
With no model there it is the home, and a model opened from it has the navbar's back
arrow to it. A view keeps its tab record in memory (`App.tsx`): the model on screen keeps
its view — camera, Display settings, pose — through updates of it, and leaving it for
another model, for the home or for another root drops it, as in the web Viewer. A view the
host creates again (its frame re-created) starts afresh: nothing names a view across its
frames, so there is nothing to keep its record under. `App.tsx` frames it (full page, or
an inline card with its full-size button). In a tab, preview's playbar sits on the line of Codex's
composer, which floats over the page (`--cad-viewport-bottom-center`), and the
home's and the explorer's lists scroll clear of it (`--cad-host-bottom-inset`).

## Develop

```bash
npm run build:mcp                             # packages, then this app
npm --prefix apps/mcp run test               # jsdom units
scripts/install/codex-dev-plugin.sh --restart   # run it in the Codex app
scripts/install/claude-dev-server.sh            # run it in Claude Desktop (then restart it)
```

`scripts/test/test-js.sh --select mcp` is what CI runs: the tests, then the
build. A checkout's `cadgen mcp` serves `apps/mcp/dist` when it exists
(`CADGEN_MCP_APP_DIR` overrides it); a wheel serves `cadgen/_runtime/mcp`,
built by `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`.
