# Scripts

Durable repo commands, one folder per concern. Every file here is called by a
GitHub Actions workflow, the pre-commit hook, a test, or a documented developer
step; nothing else belongs here (one-off helpers go in `tmp/`).

## Index

`bundle/` — cadgen's packaged runtime (`packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime`).
None of it is committed: the directory is gitignored end to end and the wheel is
where those files ship, so these scripts are what produces them.

- `bundle.sh` — the one entry point: stamps derived version metadata
  (`release/sync-version.mjs`), then runs `cadgen-runtime.sh`. `--check` builds
  the runtime and asserts every required output exists, and checks the derived
  metadata (which IS committed) rather than writing it. `--clean` removes the
  `_runtime` tree first. Called by `test.yml`, `release-publish.yml`,
  `check-builds.sh`, the pre-commit hook.
- `cadgen-runtime.sh` — builds the five runtime stages: `--node` (esbuilt Node
  builders), `--browser` (snapshot browser bundle), `--viewer` (vite build of
  `apps/web`), `--mcp` (vite build of `apps/mcp`, one `index.html`), `--native`
  (the file tracer, zig-compiled for every platform; `--native-host` builds this
  machine's only). `--print-outputs` lists the three directories a bundle always
  produces; `--check` skips the viewer and MCP stages, which need the apps'
  `node_modules` and which nothing in a checkout reads. Called by `bundle.sh`,
  `check-builds.sh`, `test/test-installed.sh`, and `test/common.sh` when a test
  runner finds a stage it needs missing; pinned by
  `tests/python/global/test_node_builder_bundles.py` and
  `test_js_runtime_reproducibility.py`. Call it directly only to debug one stage.
- `lib/node_builders.sh`, `lib/snapshot_runtime.sh` — sourced by
  `cadgen-runtime.sh`; esbuild the Node builders and the browser bundle with
  `three`/`meshoptimizer` pinned from `package-lock.json`.

`test/` — test runners.

- `test.sh` — `test-js.sh`, then `test-python.sh`, then `test-global.sh`: the
  whole tree on one machine. Called by `release-publish.yml`; `test.yml` calls
  the focused runners per job instead.
- `test-js.sh [--select core|ui|web|mcp|all]` — builds the required shared exports,
  checks dependency boundaries and runs the selected shared JS/UI/web suites.
  Core includes the pure `bench/viewer-memory/` helper units; `mcp` runs the CAD
  app's tests and builds it, since its one-file build is half its contract.
- `test-python.sh [--keep-going] [--select GROUP] [--print-weights]`
  — the cadgen package suite, then every skill's suite. Each test FILE runs in
  its own interpreter against its own temporary store, `CADGEN_TEST_JOBS` at a
  time (default: the core count; CI sets 4). `--keep-going` runs all suites and
  reports every failure.
  - `--select` picks one group: `cadgen` (the package suite, CAD Viewer backend
    included), `viewer` (that backend alone, ~11 s), `skills` (every skill's
    suite), `all` (the default).
  - `--print-weights` prints one `WEIGHT<TAB>path<TAB>seconds` line per slow file
    on stdout (everything else a run says goes to stderr): the first thing to
    read when a run is slow.
- `unittest_files.py` — the runner underneath, invoked by `common.sh`. Loads each
  test file under its full dotted path so an import failure names the file, and
  runs the files `--jobs` at a time in their own interpreters. A file still
  running after 15 minutes is hung: it prints every thread's stack and fails.
- `time-python.sh [N]` — times every Python test module on its own and prints
  them sorted by wall clock (results under `tmp/timing/`); `time_module.py` is
  its helper. Manual only: the first step of a bloat check. `--print-weights` is
  the same measurement taken from a run that was happening anyway.
- `test-global.sh` — `tests/python/global`, the repo-wide policy suite. Like
  `test-python.sh`, it builds the `--node` and `--browser` runtime stages and this
  machine's file tracer first when they are absent: the suites read them and a
  fresh clone has none.
- `test-docs.sh` — `npm --prefix apps/docs run check`, pulling the hero assets
  first. Called by `test.yml` and `release-publish.yml`.
- `test-kicad.sh` — `tests/python/packages/kicad`, the board suites that need
  KiCad 10's `kicad-cli` (and its ngspice library, for simulation) and Freerouting
  (for autorouting): boards built end to end, plotted, exported, checked,
  simulated and routed, in an isolated store. A missing tool fails the run rather
  than skipping it. Called by `test.yml` (the `kicad` job).
- `test-harness.sh` — `tests/python/packages/harness`, the wiring-harness suites
  that need WireViz's `wireviz` and Graphviz's `dot`: documents drawn and listed
  through a real WireViz. A missing tool fails the run rather than skipping it.
  Called by `test.yml` (the `harness` job).
- `test-installed.sh` — builds the wheel (or accepts `--wheel PATH` to test
  the exact artifact already built), installs it into a scratch venv and
  exercises cadgen from outside the repo, including `cadgen mcp` serving the
  packaged CAD app over stdio. Called by `test.yml` and `release-publish.yml`.
- `test-viewer-launch.sh` — launches `cadgen viewer` against the built client and
  verifies reuse, cold STEP import, display derivation and browser drawing using
  a tiny test-owned STEP. Called by `test.yml`.
- `test-viewer-browser.sh` — creates tiny inputs and owns its temporary project,
  viewer and cache. Requires a bundled viewer and npm Playwright Chromium
  (`npx --no-install playwright install chromium`). Runs the format and camera
  gates, exactly what `test.yml` runs.
  `--only NAME` selects a gate; `--out DIR` retains screenshots.
- `common.sh`, `unittest_files.py` — shared runner pieces (interpreter
  resolution, fail-closed unittest loading, the per-file parallel run). Sourced
  by the runners.

`release/` — the version and the release identity.

- `check-pr-version.sh BASE_REF HEAD_REF HEAD_SHA` — rejects VERSION edits
  outside `release/*`, comparing with the current target branch's merge base
  so inherited releases are not mistaken for PR edits. Requires fetched remote
  history; called by `test.yml`.
- `check-version.sh [--incremented-from REF]` — `VERSION` is valid semver, every
  skill pins `cadgen==VERSION`, and (with the flag) `VERSION` is greater than the
  one at `REF`. Called by `test.yml`, `release-prepare.yml`, `release-publish.yml`,
  `publish-github-release.sh`.
- `bump-version.sh major|minor|patch | --set-version X.Y.Z [--dry-run]` — writes
  `VERSION`; `--check-incremented-from REF` compares against a ref. Called by
  `release-prepare.yml` and `check-version.sh`.
- `pin-cadgen-requirements.sh [--check]` — stamps `cadgen==VERSION` into every
  skill's `requirements.txt`. Called by `release-prepare.yml`; tested by
  `tests/python/global/test_pin_cadgen_requirements.py`.
- `sync-version.mjs [--check]` — stamps the derived versions (package, plugin,
  lockfile and `pyproject.toml` metadata) from `VERSION`. Called by `bundle.sh`,
  `test.yml`, `release-prepare.yml`.
- `check-wheel-contents.sh` — builds the wheel and asserts the Python modules and
  `_runtime/{node,browser,viewer}` are inside it, with bytes identical to the
  bundled source. The only gate on package data, which fails quietly. Called by
  `test.yml` and `release-publish.yml`.
- `plugin_zip.py --out PATH | --check` — builds the plugin ZIP OpenAI's plugin
  submission portal takes (`cad/` holding `.codex-plugin/`, `skills/`,
  `LICENSE` and every file the manifest names, with the MCP config as the root
  `.mcp.json`) and checks it against the portal's documented package rules.
  Called by `release-publish.yml`; tested by
  `tests/python/global/test_plugin_zip.py`.
- `plugin_branch.py --check | --commit [--parent REF]` — builds the plugin the
  directories follow (`.claude-plugin/` manifest and icon, `.cursor-plugin/`
  manifest, `claude.mcp.json`, `skills/`, `LICENSE`, and the README with outside
  links pinned to the release commit), checks it against claude.ai's file
  rules, and with `--commit` commits it on `REF` and prints the commit. Called
  by `release-publish.yml`, whose `plugin-branch` job pushes it to the `plugin`
  branch (and to `claude-plugin` until claude.ai's listing moves); tested by
  `tests/python/global/test_plugin_branch.py`.
- `publish-github-release.sh [--target REF] [--dry-run] [--publish]` — creates and
  pushes the `v<VERSION>` tag and the GitHub Release (a draft unless
  `--publish`). Called by `release-publish.yml`; a local run on the merged release
  commit is the manual fallback.
- `release-tags.sh` — sourced helpers for tag spelling (`v0.5.0`, and the bare
  `0.4.x` releases before 0.5.0). Sourced by `bump-version.sh`,
  `publish-github-release.sh`, `release-prepare.yml`, `release-publish.yml`.

`github-workflows/` — scripts a workflow runs whole.

- `check-builds.sh [--skip-bundle-check | --tree-only]` — the shipping contract: no tracked
  symlink anywhere, no `.gitattributes` rule that rewrites files at checkout or
  changes the archive (so no LFS), every tracked file under 5 MiB, no skill
  reaching into a repo root; then `bundle.sh --check` unless the workflow
  already bundled; then every path `cadgen-runtime.sh --print-outputs` names
  exists and holds no symlink. `--tree-only` stops after the tree rules, which
  need no runtime, so `test.yml`'s Version Check runs them for every change.
  Called by `test.yml`, `release-publish.yml`, the pre-commit hook path. The
  no-symlink rule is load-bearing: Codex `plugin add` drops symlinks silently.
- `deploy-vercel-app.sh` — deploys one Vercel project to production and verifies
  its public URLs. Called by `deploy-docs.yml` only.

`install/` — local development links.

- `install-skills.sh`, `uninstall-skills.sh` — symlink `skills/*` into an agent's
  skill directory (`--agent codex|claude|...`, `--all`, `--dry-run`). Developer
  step in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `codex-dev-plugin.sh` — builds `apps/mcp` and installs this checkout into the
  Codex app as `text-to-cad@earthtojake-dev` (skills copied, server run by `.venv`,
  serving a copy of the page taken at install); `--restart` reopens the app,
  `--uninstall` removes it. Developer step in `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("CAD In Agent Hosts").
- `claude-dev-server.sh` — builds `apps/mcp` and adds this checkout's `cadgen mcp`
  to Claude Desktop's config as `cad-dev` (serving a copy of the page);
  `--uninstall` removes it. Developer step in `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("CAD In Agent
  Hosts").

`git-hooks/pre-commit` — the body `.githooks/pre-commit` runs: `bundle.sh --check`
when staged paths touch `packages`, `apps`, `skills` or `scripts/bundle`. It is
kept now that nothing is committed, because the question it asks is still worth
asking locally and is cheap once `tmp/`'s pinned esbuild toolchain exists: does
this edit still BUILD? It no longer has anything to say about the index.

`utils/list-skills.sh` — prints every `skills/*/SKILL.md` directory. Used by the
install scripts and `test-python.sh`.

`bench/` — manual edit, warm-build and viewer performance commands. See
[benchmark usage](bench/cadgen-performance/README.md). Reports and profiler
captures are local output under `tmp/`, never committed here. The drivers are
manual; their `*.test.mjs` helper units run in `test-js.sh`.

## CI

| Workflow | Branches/events | Purpose |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `test.yml` | pushes to `main`; PRs to `main`; manual dispatch | One job per thing that has to work, each conditional on the paths that can break it (`CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the graph): `Version Check` always; the cadgen package suite on Linux and Windows; `core-js` (`@text-to-cad/core`), `web` (shared UI and the web app), skills and docs on Linux; `packaging` bundles from clean (nothing under `_runtime/` is committed, so this is where it comes from), checks the layout, inspects the wheel and runs the installed-mode tests. Superseded PR runs are cancelled. |
| `release-prepare.yml` (`Prepare Release`) | manual dispatch | The version bump as a PR: bumps `VERSION`, stamps metadata and skill pins, opens `release/X.Y.Z` against `target` (default `main`; `build-test` rehearses) and merges it. The merge is what runs `Publish Release`. |
| `release-publish.yml` (`Publish Release`) | pushes to `main` and `build-test`; manual dispatch (resume/republish the head) | Gate (VERSION past the latest tag, or untagged), bundle, tests, wheel build, an `unzip -l` assertion that the shipping wheel carries `_runtime`, install test, distribution artifact, and the checked OpenAI plugin ZIP (built first, from the untouched release commit) and Claude plugin tree; then — on `main` only — PyPI upload, docs deploy, `v<VERSION>` tag and GitHub Release carrying the wheel, sdist and plugin ZIP, and the Claude plugin committed onto the `claude-plugin` branch. On `build-test` it prints what it would have tagged and stops. |
| `deploy-docs.yml` (`Deploy Docs`) | manual dispatch; called by `release-publish.yml` | Deploys the docs app to Vercel production from a ref (default `main`): configures Vercel Authentication for preview deployments only, runs `vercel pull/build/deploy --prod`, and verifies the public production URLs. |

`Prepare Release` bumps, `Publish Release` ships, `Deploy Docs`
redeploys. `main` is the one branch: the source, what installers clone, and what
releases tag; `build-test` is the rehearsal. The CAD Viewer is a local-filesystem
app with no hosted deployment.
