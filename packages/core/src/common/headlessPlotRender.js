/**
 * `cadgen pcb snapshot` in the page: a `GET /__cad/plot` payload — the SVGs a KiCad board's or
 * schematic's own tool plots — fitted on a 2D canvas, as a PNG.
 *
 * This is the CLI half of the viewer's plot pane, and shares its whole drawing path
 * (`../lib/plot2d`): the same layout of the sheets, the same fit (drawing2d's), the same frame
 * (`drawPlot`: each sheet on its own background, its SVG over it — a board's every layer, back
 * to front, poured, seen from the top), on the same theme surround. The pane keeps rasters of
 * the SVGs so a pan costs nothing; this draws the SVGs themselves, once, which is what those
 * rasters are made of. So a CLI render cannot show what the pane cannot.
 *
 * The payload arrives over the snapshot host's loopback asset server rather than inside the
 * job, as a drawing's does: cadgen plots it with `kicad-cli`, caches it in the store and writes
 * the bytes to a file the page fetches. A board's SVG runs to tens of megabytes; inlined in the
 * job it would cross the Playwright driver pipe as one escaped protocol message.
