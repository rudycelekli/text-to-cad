    extraction, an interference check). See :func:`_track_spec_generation`: getting this
    wrong makes an export look like a build to the CAD Viewer.

    ``model_prints_to_stdout`` decides where the MODEL's own ``print()`` output
    lands. The CLI contract is "stdout carries the result; stderr carries
    progress" — and when a generator runs as a subroutine of another verb
    (``inspect``, ``snapshot``, a mesh export), its prints ahead of the verb's
    JSON broke every ``| jq`` pipeline. So the default routes them to stderr
    with the rest of the progress; only the direct build flows (``cadgen step
    build``, ``python model.py``), where the model's stdout is the user's own
    channel, pass True.

    Closure capture is deterministic in every process shape: first-party modules
    are evicted from ``sys.modules`` BEFORE the generator loads (so its full
    dependency closure is freshly imported on every run — warm worker, multi-target
    CLI loop, or cold process alike, and regardless of earlier failed builds), and
    every first-party file EXECUTED during the run is recorded via the ``exec``
    audit event (so dependencies survive even when a generator unloads modules
    from ``sys.modules`` mid-run). Only first-party ``.py`` modules are evicted
    (see :func:`repo_local_loaded_modules`); the running runtime (cadgen, the CLI
    launcher) and C extensions / site-packages (numpy, OCP, build123d) are never
    touched — they cannot reload, must stay warm, and are not freshness inputs.
