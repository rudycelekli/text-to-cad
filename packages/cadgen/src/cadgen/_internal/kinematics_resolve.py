"""Build-time kinematics resolution: refs -> numbers.

One job, against the freshly built tree, before the sidecar is written:
every mate's parent/child occurrence ref must name a real occurrence, and every
``axis={"ref": ...}`` selector becomes world-at-rest ``{"origin", "dir"}``
numbers via the same composed selector index inspect uses. The sidecar carries
only numbers — the viewer does arithmetic, never topology.

A mate's ends name occurrences, so they resolve in the tree's occurrence
namespace alone: its leaves, its group nodes and their labels, read from the
flattened tree. No component's topology is read for them. An axis ref names a
face or edge of one occurrence, and only that occurrence's component is read:
its selector rows come from its SURF, derived through the build pool when the
store has none.

Nothing here moves geometry. A kinematics declaration describes how the
written tree articulates; the tree itself is the model's return value and is
stored exactly as returned.
