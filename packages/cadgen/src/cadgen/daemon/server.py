"""Warm-process daemon supervisor for cadgen's build doors.

The supervisor owns a socket and a pool of warm workers (``cadgen.daemon.pool``),
each a subprocess that imported cadgen / OCP / build123d once. It services
directly-run @step/@dxf model scripts ("run") plus ``cadgen step build|compile``
and ``cadgen stl|3mf|glb build`` invocations (snapshot orchestration stays in its
caller; only its document compiles and surface derivations are pool jobs)
over a per-install unix socket (named pipe on Windows), so every
call skips the multi-second interpreter+OCP startup. The supervisor itself never
imports OCP: no amount of model badness can take it down.

Protocol — one JSON request per connection, JSON-lines response:

  request : {"tool": <a key of _TOOL_IMPORTS below>,
             "argv": [...], "cwd": "...", "prog": "...",
             "store_root": "...", "root_id": "..." | null,
             "env": {...}, "token": <client version token>}
  response: {"stream": "stdout"|"stderr", "data": "..."} chunks and
            {"event": {...}} build-tree events, then {"exit": <int>} — or
            {"restart": true} when the client's version token differs from the
            daemon's startup token, after which the daemon finishes the jobs it
            is running and exits so the client can respawn a fresh one. It gives
            up its address and singleton lock together, before any teardown --
            before that reply when nothing is running -- so the respawn binds.

Routing: a request that names a model script goes to THAT model's worker
(STORE.md §9). A busy worker means an extra, never a wait; a model with no
worker binds a spare; no spare means a spawn. Requests that name no script
borrow a spare for one job. Nothing here caps, counts memory or queues.
