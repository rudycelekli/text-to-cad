"""One warm OCP process. Reads job requests on stdin, writes framed output on stdout.

The daemon used to run tools inside itself, which capped it at one job forever: a tool
needs ``os.chdir`` and ``sys.argv``, and those are process globals. Moving the work into
subprocesses gives each job its own globals, so concurrency across workers costs nothing
to reason about — and a model that segfaults OCP takes down one worker instead of the
daemon.

The frames here are deliberately the same shape the daemon sends its client
(``{"stream": ..., "data": ...}`` then ``{"exit": ...}``), so the supervisor is a pure
relay and the client's wire protocol is untouched. A third frame, ``{"event": ...}``,
carries build-tree events (STORE.md §Lazy children): a child a model's body submits
from inside this worker reports through the same channel as the worker's own output.
A fourth, ``{"heartbeat": {"phase": ..., "cpu": ...}}``, is the worker's liveness
while a job runs (``_heartbeat``); the supervisor consumes it and never relays it.
A fifth, ``{"artifactNext": true}``, is an artifact job asking before each derivation
whether anyone still wants it (``_wanted``); the supervisor answers ``{"goOn": ...}``
on stdin and never relays it.

One request kind, ``run`` — a CLI tool, output streamed as frames. The store root
arrives on every request (``store_root``) and is applied per job, so one daemon serves
any number of isolated stores and a worker never inherits the root of whichever build
spawned the daemon.

Exits when stdin closes, so a supervisor that dies cannot leave a 274 MB OCP process
behind.
