"""The warm worker pool: a worker per model, an extra when it is busy, spares in reserve.

One rule decides routing here: **nothing waits on another build.** A request
for a model whose worker is idle takes that worker. A request for a model whose
worker is busy gets an *extra* — a spare bound to the same model for the length
of one job — and runs now. A request for a model with no worker binds a spare. A
request with no spare left spawns if its memory reservation fits. Admission
counts resident worker trees (including extraction children), keeps headroom
for dependencies, and reclaims idle workers first. That reservation is not
configured: it starts at the seed and is recalibrated on every accounting pass
from the RSS of workers that are idle and have run nothing, which is what a
worker costs before geometry (``memory.worker_baseline``). The dependency
headroom follows from the same number. Exhaustion waits for the
builds in flight to finish (a parent fanning out its children submits them all
at once, and only a core's worth can run) and fails explicitly only when nothing
is running that could release memory. These are soft RSS and
reservation bounds, not a hard limit on a native operation's allocations.
Publication ordering remains the publish rule's concern.

Spares: ``CADGEN_DAEMON_SPARES`` (default 2) workers that have finished importing
build123d and are bound to nothing. Binding one starts a replacement in the
background when memory permits, so a new model's first build pays no import.
A subject-less job borrows one without replacing it. Surplus workers from a
burst remain reusable for two idle seconds, then the periodic sweep restores K.
An extra returns to the spare set when its job ends; a primary stays bound
until idle timeout, memory pressure or recycling reclaims it.

Recycle: a worker is dropped after ``CADGEN_DAEMON_RECYCLE`` jobs (default 1000)
as a leak hedge; its model binds a fresh worker on the next request.

Workers read frames on a thread so every read honours a timeout: a worker that
hangs before announcing itself, or mid-job, is reported instead of blocking its
caller forever. Either way "hangs" means silence with no CPU progress. Mid-job, a
running job beats (``worker._heartbeat``), and a worker whose heartbeat a
GIL-holding native call starves is still computing, which its CPU clock shows
(``Worker.frames``). Starting, a worker imports the kernel, a few CPU seconds that
a busy machine spreads over minutes; it is waited for while its clock moves
(``Worker._announced``).
