# these the first build's cache root silently became every later build's,

# cache for every other project on the machine until the daemon recycled).
# They travel with every request and the worker applies them per JOB —
# a name absent here means "unset for this job" (see worker._apply_request_env).
# PYTHONPATH rides along too: it is how a project declares an import root beyond the
# script's own folder (``PYTHONPATH=src``), and a build must resolve imports exactly as
# ``python script.py`` run by the client would. Entries are absolutized against the
# client's cwd, because the worker runs elsewhere.
# CADGEN_FFMPEG is the same kind of per-client choice: `snapshot --video` encodes
# with the ffmpeg the CALLER has, and a warm worker's ambient PATH is whatever
# shell happened to start the daemon. CADGEN_STORE_MAX is the cap the daemon's
# idle housekeeping holds the client's store to (STORE.md §8). CADGEN_VERIFY_READBACK
# is one build's request (STORE.md §10): a daemon started with it verified every
