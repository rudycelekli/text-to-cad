"""The PCB authoring model: what an ``@pcb`` function builds and returns.

A :class:`Board` holds a circuit and its layout, named in KiCad's own words:

- **parts** come from KiCad's libraries, a symbol (``Device:R``) and a
  footprint (``Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric``), and get a reference
  (``R1``) and a value;
- **nets** join part pins: ``board.connect(vbus, j1[1], u1["VI"])``. A pin is
  named by its number or, when that is unambiguous, by its name;
- **placement** is its own step, ``board.place(part, at=(x, y))``, so a
  subcircuit written as a plain function adds parts to a board or to a
  simulation testbench alike;
- **copper** is tracks, arcs, vias and zones on KiCad's layers (``F.Cu``,
  ``B.Cu``, ``In1.Cu``...), and **keepouts** forbid copper in an area;
- **shapes** (the outline and its cutouts, a zone's area, a keepout) are
  build123d 2D geometry, the same contract ``@dxf`` drawings use.

Coordinates are millimetres with y UP, as build123d's are, and the board's
(0, 0) is wherever the outline puts it: the KiCad files carry the same origin
as their drill/place origin, so the board's STEP export lands exactly on the
enclosure it was drawn against. Rotation is degrees counter-clockwise seen from
the top; a part on the ``"bottom"`` side is mirrored as KiCad mirrors it.

Nothing here talks to KiCad. Library lookups happen when a part is created
(the files read are the build's inputs); everything KiCad itself decides --
filled zones, clearances, connectivity -- happens when the build writes the
board and runs ``kicad-cli`` over it.
