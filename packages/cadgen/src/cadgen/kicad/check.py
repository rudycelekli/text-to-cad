"""KiCad's verdict on a board: fill its zones, run ERC and DRC, keep the result.

:func:`build_board` is what an ``@pcb`` build runs. It stages the project's
three documents in a temporary folder and asks ``kicad-cli`` for:

- the ERC of the schematic;
- the DRC of the board, with the schematic-to-board parity check, after
  refilling every zone (``--refill-zones --save-board``).

A board that asked for autorouting (``board.autoroute()``) is routed by
Freerouting before it is staged (:mod:`cadgen.kicad.route`): its tracks and
vias join cadgen's tree, so KiCad fills around them and checks them like any
the script drew.

KiCad's saved board is read back for one thing only, the copper it filled each
zone with (``filled_polygon``), which is merged into cadgen's own tree by zone
UUID. The board cadgen writes is therefore cadgen's bytes (and the router's)
plus KiCad's fill: the same board always writes the same file.

:func:`check_project` runs the same checks on any KiCad project, a person's
included, for ``cadgen pcb validate``.

Positions in findings are in the board script's coordinates: millimetres, y
up, from the board's drill/place origin (where cadgen puts the script's
origin; on a board KiCad's GUI drew, wherever its author left that origin).
