"""The public ``pcb`` namespace: the ``@pcb`` decorator, the board API, and its verbs.

``@pcb`` DECLARES a printed circuit board model (``@pcb(gerber=True, bom=True,
pos=True)`` with its manufacturing files); ``pcb.Board`` is what its function
builds and returns; ``pcb.validate(...)`` checks any KiCad project, and
``pcb.gerber``/``pcb.bom``/``pcb.pos`` write a saved board's manufacturing files.
They are the same object -- this module is callable (see
:mod:`cadgen._internal.format_namespace`) -- so ``from cadgen import pcb``
gives a model script all three.

A board is written as a KiCad project: ``<name>.kicad_pro``,
``<name>.kicad_sch``, ``<name>.kicad_pcb`` and its custom design rules,
``<name>.kicad_dru``. KiCad itself (its command line, ``kicad-cli``) fills the
zones and runs the electrical and design rule checks inside every build; a
build with errors writes nothing.

``pcb.Testbench`` simulates a board's subcircuits with ngspice, the simulator
KiCad ships: a circuit like a board, built by the same functions, whose runs
are facts for a script to assert (``pcb.SimulationError`` when ngspice cannot
solve it).

``pcb.read_board(path)`` reads any KiCad board back for the references a
person copies from the viewer (``#U3``, ``#U3.9``, ``#net:VIN``,
``#net:VIN@x40.1y21.6``, ``#@x40.1y21.6``): ``.resolve(ref)`` answers what one
names, in the script's coordinates, and a part's ``script`` is the line that
made it (:mod:`cadgen.kicad.board_index`). ``pcb.read_schematic(path)`` answers
the same references on a schematic (``#U3``, ``#U3.9``, ``#net:VIN``), sheets
within sheets included: a part with the units it draws on each sheet, a pin, a
net by KiCad's own name, from one run of KiCad's netlist export
(:mod:`cadgen.kicad.schematic_index`).

Import discipline: nothing here pulls in OCP or touches KiCad at module scope.
