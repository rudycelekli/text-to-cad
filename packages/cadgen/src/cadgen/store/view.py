"""Views of a tree for consumers that speak the view layout (assembly.json + components/).

Two consumers cannot read objects by hash directly: the Node builders (the
mesh exporter takes ``--package-dir``) and the browser (the viewer/snapshot
client resolves ``assembly.json`` and ``components/<cid>.surf`` RELATIVE to a
package URL). Neither gets a directory in the store — the store has no result
directories. They get a **view**:

- :func:`export_view` writes the flattened tree (assembly.json) plus every component it
  references into a TEMPORARY directory outside the store (copies; the
  objects are small and the view is short-lived). Callers own its lifetime.
- :func:`virtual_path` resolves a view-relative path (``<tree>/assembly.json``,
  ``<tree>/components/<object>.surf``) to bytes on demand, so an HTTP route can
  present a tree as if it were a view directory without writing anything.
