"""The gate: one ``stale(model)`` for every model, root or leaf.

``stale(x)`` is true if any of:

1. no record;
2. ``sha256(closure.files as they are now) != closure.hash`` — a file the
   record sliced (``closure.names``) keeps its recorded slice while its
   whole-file hash is the recorded one (``closure.wholes``) and is re-sliced
   by those names when it moved, every other file hashed whole — or a constant
   the model imported by value (``record.constants``) no longer hashes the same;
3. for any recorded child: ``stale(child)`` **or** its current tree hash != the
   pinned hash;
4. the tree object or any object it (transitively) references is missing;
5. any declared output does not match ``outputs``.

Evaluated once in the requesting process (fast, no kernel import) and again on
the worker immediately before building. Recursion in (3) is memoized per request.
Clauses 4 and 5 verify an object or an output once per process, while its file
keeps the settled identity that verification observed (STORE.md §4).
Mesh tolerances and argv flags are not inputs.
