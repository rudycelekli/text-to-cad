"""Content-addressed objects: a component's bytes or a tree's JSON.

An object is named by the sha256 of its bytes and sharded ``ab/cdef…`` like
git. Writing is idempotent and atomic (temp + rename), so a reader can never
observe a partial object. Explicit recovery can replace bytes that no longer
match their address; a valid existing object is never rewritten.

A write that finds its bytes already present is a REUSE, and a reuse claims
the object: its mtime becomes now, less two ticks of its filesystem's clock
(:func:`claim_object`). The sweeper keeps anything claimed within its grace
window and deletes only by rename, then recheck (:func:`delete_unclaimed`), so
an object a publish has claimed is never deleted under it (STORE.md §8).

This process also remembers the file identity -- device, inode, size, mtime,
ctime -- under which it last hashed each object's bytes to their address
(:func:`verified_stamp`), once that identity is settled: read far enough past
the write it observed that a later write must stamp a different mtime
(:func:`_stamp_is_settled`, STORE.md §10). A claim is the one write this
process makes to an object it has verified, so a claim carries the identity
forward instead of invalidating it (STORE.md §8).
