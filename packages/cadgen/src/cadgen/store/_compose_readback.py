"""Compose an all-link parent's saved-document tree from its children's.

A parent that returns only placed children writes a STEP whose products are
the children's documents again: ``materialize_descriptor`` places every leaf
at its flattened world transform and every group at the identity, and the
writer emits each child's prototypes from the same bytes the child's own save
emitted. A child's read-back is therefore context-free: the components,
hierarchy, names, colours and the linear part of every leaf placement read
back from the parent's STEP are exactly those in the child's own document
tree, and only each leaf's translation is new. That translation is the one
number the parent's descriptor hands the writer, ``fl(child + link)``, and
what the reader gives back for it is its STEP text round trip
(:func:`written_real`). So the parent's canonical document tree can be
composed, bit for bit, without parsing the STEP the build just wrote.

Eligibility is exact and every other case takes the ordinary read-back:

- the parent result is links only (no own geometry);
- every link placement is a pure translation (its linear part is exactly the
  identity) with no link colour, and every link and group name survives
  ``_normalize_label_name``;
- every child's document tree is pinned by its record for the tree the parent
  used, is complete, has an assembly root, holds only native components, and
  names every node;
- every leaf box the canonical bounds path would take is already in
  ``index/bounds`` under the child's publication, with a leaf layout whose
  leaves all sit at the prototype's placement;
- the writer emulation reproduces every translation in each child's own
  document from that child's descriptor (checked here, every time).

Nothing here consults a record or a source file: the caller resolves child
pins to document trees, and composition reads objects and the bounds index.
