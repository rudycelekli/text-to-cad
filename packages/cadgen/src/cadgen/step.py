"""The public ``step`` format namespace: the ``@step`` decorator and its verbs.

``@step`` DECLARES a model; the verbs OPERATE on documents. They are the same
object — this module is callable (see
:mod:`cadgen._internal.format_namespace`) — so a format is one table row:
decorator, verbs, and generated CLI together (design/format-doors.md).

Two verbs make documents, and the difference is what lands on disk:

* ``compile`` is a CACHE action — a document in, its tree in the
  store, the document untouched. It is INTERNAL: every door and the viewer
  compile a missing package on demand, so no skill teaches the command.
* ``build`` writes a NEW document — ``IN.step OUT.step`` — re-emitted through
  cadgen's own pipeline (OCCT read -> package -> canonical XCAF writer), so the
  output's bytes are deterministic whichever kernel wrote the input, and
  optionally annotated with ``kinematics=``. OUT is REQUIRED,
  which is what tells the two verbs apart at the command line.

Model scripts are RUN, never passed here: ``python model.py`` is the one source
door (design/pose-animation-split.md, CLI/doors follow-on). Every verb takes a
DOCUMENT and refuses a ``.py`` by naming the run.

Import discipline: nothing here may pull in OCP/build123d at module scope. A
model script pays this import before its freshness gate runs, and the whole
point of the ~0.2s pre-gate budget is that a current model never wakes the CAD
kernel. Every heavy import lives inside a verb body.
