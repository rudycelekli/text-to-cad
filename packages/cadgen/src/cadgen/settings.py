"""The person's settings: one file, ``settings.json``, in the state directory beside the model
library, so both CAD apps (``cadgen mcp`` and ``cadgen viewer``) and every version of cadgen read
the same answers -- nothing an install or an update replaces holds them. Deleting the state
directory forgets them.

The file is one JSON object with a section per feature, each owned by the module that uses it
(``analytics``: the answer to the analytics question, ``cadgen/analytics.py``; ``features``: the
CAD views' features a person turned off, ``cadgen/features.py``). A change reads,
changes and writes its own section under one lock (``update_section``), so two apps changing
settings at once never undo each other, whichever sections they touch.
