"""The CAD Viewer's HTTP routes, served in-process for a view with no network.

A view sends exactly the requests the web client sends (``/__cad/*``,
``/__tess_cache/*``) as tool calls; this module hands each one to the viewer's
own router -- one :class:`~cadgen.viewer.http_app.CadApp` per root -- and returns
the status, headers and body bytes. There is one backend, not two: the router,
its path containment and its limits are the ones the web app uses.

A body travels base64 inside the host's JSON, and a JSON body of more than
``GZIP_JSON_MIN_BYTES`` travels gzipped as well, flagged ``encoding: "gzip"``: the
page inflates it before the client sees it, and the headers describe the inflated
body. A large model's descriptor is 1.43 MB of base64 as it is and 0.28 MB gzipped,
for about 5 ms of level-1 compression. Binary bodies (tessellations, SURF objects)
barely shrink, so they travel as they are.

A reply is one message on the host's channel, and a host reads that channel with
a ceiling on one message: past it, the connection closes, and this process and
every view on it end. So no reply carries more than ``MAX_REPLY_BYTES`` of body.
The page asks for every GET as a byte range of at most that (``Range``), and a
longer body answers with its first part, ``content-range`` and an ``etag``
(``cadgen.viewer.response``): the page reads the rest a range at a time, from
the same body. Any reply still longer is not sent: that request fails (502).
