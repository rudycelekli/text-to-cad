"""A link to a model in the CAD Viewer, for an app that cannot show CAD views itself.

``cadgen viewer --json --detach``, run from a folder, reuses the Viewer serving that folder or starts
one in the background (its own session, its output to a log beside its registry entry), prints its
``{url, port, action}`` line and exits. So a started Viewer outlives this server, as one an agent
starts from a shell does, and nothing it writes later comes back here. It never opens a browser: the
link is the user's to open.
