"""Anonymous usage analytics for CAD's two apps -- ``cadgen mcp`` (the CAD app in an agent app) and
``cadgen viewer`` (the browser viewer): how many people use CAD, how often, and on how many files --
counts, times and metadata, never what anything says. Every CAD task shows its model in one or the
other, so between them they see CAD's use; the CLI and the library send nothing.

What is sent, at most once a minute while there is something new and once more as the server
exits, each batch stamped with the time it arrives:

- who, anonymously: a random install id, and a random id for this server process;
- what runs: cadgen's version, how it was installed, the operating system and processor, the
  agent app's name and version and how that app shows CAD (tabs, inline or text) -- or, from the
  browser viewer, ``cadgen-viewer`` and ``browser``;
- ``tool``: how many times each CAD tool was called, and how many of those failed;
- ``view``: how many times a CAD view was touched by a person or switched models -- time spent
  looking at a model calls no tool, and is use all the same;
- ``file``: each distinct file the agent showed or a person touched in a CAD view (a view left
  open on a model notes nothing), once a day per server process, as a
  16-character code (an HMAC of its absolute path keyed by a random salt made on this machine
  and never sent) and its format (``step``, ``stl``, ...). The receiver can count distinct
  files and see one come back on another day; it cannot learn a path, a name or what is in a
  file, and a code means nothing on any other machine.

Never a path, a file name, a model, an argument, a prompt or anything typed. A batch with
nothing used in it is never sent: a server the host started and nobody used counts for
nothing. The receiver (``ENDPOINT``) is ours, so the service behind it can change without a
release.

Nothing is sent without the person's yes, however CAD was installed. Strongest first:

1. The environment: ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1`` or ``CADGEN_ANALYTICS=0`` turns it off,
   ``CADGEN_ANALYTICS=1`` on.
2. The person's choice, kept as the ``analytics`` section of their settings (``cadgen/settings.py``:
   ``settings.json`` in the state directory) and shared by both apps:
   either app's card or its Settings, ``cadgen analytics on|off``, or the agent's
   ``cad_analytics`` (off only).
3. Otherwise nothing is sent, and whichever app the person opens first asks once.

A no, or closing the card, is kept like a yes and never asked again: not after a restart, not
after an update, not when what is sent grows (``DISCLOSURE`` re-asks only a yes). Where an answer
could not be kept -- a state directory nothing can write -- the CAD app does not ask at all.

How CAD was installed (``cadgen mcp --install store``, a plugin directory's) is only
reported, as ``source``: it decides nothing.

The install id and the file salt exist only while sharing is on: turning it off deletes both
here and asks the receiver to delete what it holds under the id -- again and again until it
hears back -- and turning it on again starts a new install with a new salt, so nothing links
the two.

Analytics never get in the way of CAD:

- Nothing here raises into the server. Every ``Recorder`` method is guarded: a failure (an
  unreadable state directory, a broken receiver, a bug here) is logged at debug level, below
  what ``cadgen mcp`` prints, so nothing reaches a host's or an agent's logs, and answered
  with a safe default: not sharing, nothing sent, nothing asked.
- No tool call waits on the network. Noting use is in memory; sending, and the deletion an
  opt-out asks for, run on a background thread. The one wait is the last send as the server
  exits, bounded by ``CLOSE_SECONDS``.
- A batch the receiver did not take (offline, a slow or broken receiver, or none answering
  there yet) is kept for the next one; it is never an error. One the receiver read and refused
  (``REFUSED``) is dropped: it would be refused again, and take everything after it down with it.

The answer is changed only under the settings lock (``settings.update_section``), so the CAD app
and the browser viewer answering, opting out or making the install's id at once never undo one
another. A settings file that is there but cannot be read counts as no answer that can be kept
("unavailable"), never as no answer yet, and is never written back over.
