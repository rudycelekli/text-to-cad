"""Document compiles for the CAD Viewer: jobs in cadgen's pool.

The viewer renders what exists. Its one build-shaped action is compiling a
document whose BYTES have no tree yet — a vendor ``.step`` dropped into the
directory, or a generated one built into another store — and that is a compile
JOB submitted to the pool (``cadgen.daemon.executors.submit_compile``): the same
job a door submits when handed such a document. It runs on a daemon spare (or a
transient subprocess under ``CADGEN_DAEMON=0``), takes a job slot, coalesces
with a door compiling the same bytes and shows in the build tree. Nothing here
loads the kernel; the server never does.

Concurrent viewer requests for one document attach to the first: one job, one
answer for all of them. Progress reaches the status endpoint through the
daemon's job ledger (``build_progress``), not through this module — the job is
the producer, this is a waiter.

The viewer's build request STARTS a compile (:meth:`DocumentCompiler.start`) and
answers at once; it never holds its request for the job's length (a host that
relays requests through a few shared slots would lose one for that long). The
client follows the job through the status route, as it follows a peer's, and a
compile that failed is remembered against the document's bytes so the status
route can say so rather than offer the same compile again. A document that
refused to be READ (an ``OSError``: on Windows, another program holding or
replacing it) is remembered only long enough for that report
(:data:`READ_REFUSAL_REPORT_SECONDS`): nothing about its bytes is known, and the
next open or reload compiles it again.
