"""Single-port CAD Viewer server and instance manager: ``cadgen viewer``.

Launching is UNCONDITIONAL, Jupyter-style: running ``cadgen viewer`` from a
directory always ends with the URL of a live, correct Viewer for that directory.
If an identity-probed instance already serves ``realpath(cwd)`` at this identity
token (version plus the runtime content digest — see ``identity_token``),
its URL is printed with ``action:"reused"`` and nothing is spawned (``--new``
skips the lookup); otherwise the server binds the first free port from 3245
upward and prints ``action:"started"``. An EXPLICIT ``--port`` stays strict — it
exits 1 when taken — because then the port was the ask. The printed URL (and the
``--json {url,port,action}`` line) is the contract; the port is an output of
launch, never something the caller reasons about.

A launch that STARTS a server is that server and stays in the foreground; a
launch that reuses one prints and exits. ``--detach`` makes both return: the
server runs in the background (its own session, output to a log beside its
registry entry) and the launcher exits once it has announced itself — the
spelling for agents and scripts, which wait for a command to finish.

Also the instance manager: ``cadgen viewer list [--json]`` shows every running
Viewer (identity-probed, stale entries reaped) and ``cadgen viewer stop --port
<n>`` / ``--pid <n>`` terminates one. These live here rather than in a separate
tool because the registry the server writes is the only source of truth. Dev
never registers (``--no-registry``): the registry is installed instances only.

Three flags exist for the dev server and nowhere else: ``--ephemeral`` (bind any
free port), ``--no-registry`` (stay out of reuse), and ``--api-only`` (serve the
two API prefixes and nothing else, because Vite owns the client — this is what
lets ``npm run dev`` work on a checkout that has never been built).

A Viewer serves ONE directory: the one it is launched from. There is no flag
for it — the cwd IS the served directory, so the caller chooses what to serve
by choosing where to run. The page is always the bare origin; ``?file=``
selects a file inside that directory. To serve a second directory, just launch
again from it.

Launch is::

    cd <the directory to serve>
    cadgen viewer            # or: python -m cadgen.viewer

There is no interpreter discovery, and deliberately so: an earlier backend
searched ``$CADGEN_PYTHON``, ``PATH``, and ``<servedRoot>/.venv/bin/python``,
which meant OPENING AN UNTRUSTED FOLDER THAT SHIPS A .venv handed it the
interpreter to execute. The server IS the interpreter that installed cadgen.
Do not reintroduce a search in any form.

# server spawns — and on 3.9 the server BOOTS, prints the URL contract, and
# then answers the very first catalog request with a raw
# `realpath() got an unexpected keyword argument 'strict'`. A tool that starts
# and then fails on first contact is worse than one that refuses to start, so
# it refuses to start. pip enforces cadgen's own floor for an installed wheel;
# this covers a source tree reached through PYTHONPATH, where nothing else does.
#
# The floor is 3.11, not the 3.10 today's code strictly needs (`strict=` landed
# in 3.10): 3.11 is what cadgen's metadata requires, and one number that is
# true everywhere beats two that drift. Everything in this block is

    reason: Windows hands a process the legacy code page, and under strict
    error handling a character it cannot represent raises UnicodeEncodeError
    from the MESSAGE rather than from the work. The viewer's narration carries
    em dashes (the dist-staleness warning) and, worse, arbitrary user paths.

    Only the error HANDLER changes, never the encoding — switching the viewer's
    streams to utf-8 would make it emit bytes that no Windows consumer decodes
    the way the platform says to, which is the experiment
    ``cli._harden_std_stream_errors`` documents having tried and reverted.

    Reached from BOTH entry points: ``cadgen viewer`` arrives already hardened
    through ``cadgen.cli.main``, but ``python -m cadgen.viewer`` does not — and
    neither does the process a development restart re-executes, which is spelled
    exactly that way.

    The child is the ordinary foreground launch — the same arguments minus
    ``--detach``, plus ``--json`` — in its own session (its own process group

    down. Its stdout and stderr go to a log file beside its registry entry,

    nobody reads would fail on its next line. The log is created here, under a
    name that never changes (``registry.create_log``), and handed to the child
    in ``CADGEN_VIEWER_LOG`` so its registry entry names it — whether or not
    this launcher is still alive when the server comes up. It outlives the
    server: a clean ``stop`` removes it, and a crash leaves it to read.
    Readiness is the child's own announcement, which it writes only once it is
    bound, attached and registered, so the URL printed here answers its first
