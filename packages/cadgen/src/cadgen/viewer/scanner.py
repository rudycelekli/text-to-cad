"""CAD directory scanner — produces the raw viewer catalog.

A raw entry is ``{file, kind, url, hash, bytes, ...}``: ``file`` is
root-relative POSIX, ``url`` is repo-relative (``/seg/seg?v=<token>``) and gets
rewritten to the ``/__cad/asset?file=...`` form by the backend's absolutizer,
``hash`` is sha256 hex, ``bytes`` is the byte size, and the ``?v=`` token is
``base36(size)-base36(mtime_ns)``.

The catalog is ARTIFACTS-ONLY. Model scripts are never entries: a model with no
artifact simply does not appear until its script has been run, and
artifact-to-source linkage is assembly.json provenance rather than filenames. The
catalog publishes no provenance at all — never a ``sourceKind``, never a
generator script name.

FIDELITY NOTES (each one is a place a "natural" Python spelling diverges)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ``file`` refs are POSIX BY CONTRACT because they become URLs.
  ``os.path.join`` would spell them ``library\\part.step`` on Windows and never
  match.
* Directory symlinks are followed ON PURPOSE. ``Dirent.isDirectory()`` is false
  for a link, which is why link targets get an explicit follow-stat here too;
  loops terminate on a set of visited REAL directory paths, with the depth cap
  as the outer guard.
* Walk order is ``readdir`` sorted by JS string comparison, which is UTF-16
  CODE-UNIT order. Python's ``sorted`` is code-POINT order and the two disagree
  above U+E000, so names sort on their UTF-16-BE encoding. This leaks into the
  output: the catalog sort is stable and primary-strength collation produces a
  lot of ties, so tied entries keep their walk order.
* ``path.extname`` is not ``os.path.splitext`` (see ``content_types``).
* JS ``\\s`` and ``\\w`` are not Python's, so ``_xml_root_name`` spells both
  character classes out.
* A ``kinematics: {}`` object is a declaration even though Python considers it
  falsey, so it still emits ``poseUrl``.

# --- directory listing cache ----------------------------------------------
#
# The catalog is re-read on every poll (the client polls every 2s, and the
# artifact status route reads it too), and a served root can hold a project's
# scratch: hundreds of thousands of renders, BREPs and logs that are not
# artifacts. Re-listing all of them per request made every request cost a full
# walk. So each directory's RELEVANT rows — subdirectories the walk descends
# into, symlinks, and CAD files — are memoised on that directory's own
# identity, and a warm walk costs one stat per directory rather than one entry
# per file.
#
# Adding, removing or renaming an entry moves its directory's mtime and ctime,
# and a changed identity is a miss; a file's CONTENT is not a listing fact
# (catalog rows fingerprint their own files). Symlinks are cached as links and
# their targets are re-stated on every walk, because a target can change
# without its link's directory changing. Where the stamps can fail to move,
# three rules keep that from hiding a change for long:
#
# * Timestamp granularity. A change landing in the same clock tick as the
#   listing leaves both stamps where they were, so a listing is trusted only
#   once its directory's NEWER stamp is ``_LISTING_SETTLE_NS`` old when it is
#   read (the "racy git" rule), covering 1s HFS+ and 2s FAT stamps. A directory
#   being written right now is simply re-listed on every walk.
# * Stamps that are not times. A macOS exFAT volume root reports mtime and
#   ctime 0 and never moves either, and FAT cannot store a time before 1980. A
#   directory with either stamp at or before ``_PLAUSIBLE_STAMP_NS`` is
#   re-listed on every walk.
# * Stamps put back. tar, unzip, rsync -a and cp -p restore a directory's mtime
#   after filling it. Where ctime is real (APFS, HFS+, ext4) the kernel moves
#   it anyway, but FAT and exFAT keep none (they report mtime as ctime) and
#   Windows reports creation time in its place, so the identity can repeat
#   exactly. Nothing on disk can catch that, so no listing is trusted for more
#   than ``_LISTING_TTL_NS``: past that age a walk re-lists the directory
#   whatever its stamps say. At the client's 2 s poll, 10 s keeps four polls in
#   five warm (the fifth costs what every poll used to) and bounds how long such
#   a change can stay out of the catalog.
#
# An untrusted listing is still recorded, never served: it is what tells the
# next listing of that directory which subdirectories have since gone, and a
# directory that has gone takes everything remembered beneath it along. The
