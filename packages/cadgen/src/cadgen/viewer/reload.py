"""Development auto-reload: a Viewer run from a source CHECKOUT restarts itself.

This is a development convenience — the ``uvicorn --reload`` of this server —
and it exists in exactly one situation: cadgen imported from a source checkout.
The installed wheel carries none of it. No watcher thread starts, no digest is
computed, nothing restarts, and ``/__cad/server`` reports ``autoReload: false``,
because nothing edits a wheel's Python underneath a running server and a tool a
user installed must never restart itself.

THE PREDICATE, IN ONE PLACE
    ``running_from_source_checkout()`` is the only thing that decides. The
    directory holding the ``cadgen`` package is named ``src`` and its parent
    holds a ``pyproject.toml`` that names cadgen — which is exactly this repo's
    ``packages/cadgen/src/cadgen``, and exactly what an EDITABLE install
    resolves to (however the finder got there, the modules' ``__file__``
    points into the checkout). A wheel lands in ``site-packages``, whose parent
    holds no project file, so it reads false. Deliberately NOT an environment
    variable: an env var is a second predicate, and two predicates drift.

WHAT IS WATCHED
    Every ``.py`` under the cadgen package, not just ``cadgen/viewer``: this
    server imports the daemon client, the store and the transport, and
    watching the viewer alone left it running against changed code it had
    already imported. ``__pycache__`` and ``_runtime`` are skipped — a
    byte-identical tree must not read as changed because an interpreter
    recompiled it.

    The BUILT CLIENT is deliberately not watched. Development is
    ``npm run dev``, where Vite owns the client and HMR already handles it; a
    checkout's ``cadgen viewer`` serves the last ``npm run build`` on purpose
    (see apps/web/README.md). Keeping a stale ``dist/`` in sync is not this
    module's job.

HOW IT DECIDES
    Two stages, the same shape as the launcher's identity token: a cheap
    name/size/mtime signature guards a content digest, and only a CONTENT
    change counts. A ``touch``, or a rebuild that produces the same bytes,
    restarts nothing. The comparison is against the digest taken when THIS
    process started, so an edit that is undone before the restart fires simply
    stops being pending.

    The cheap guard is skipped ONCE A RESTART IS PENDING. It exists to keep the
    idle path free, and it cannot be trusted to report a tree settling back:
    Windows stamps a write from the ~15.6ms interrupt clock, so an edit and the
    edit that undoes it can land in one tick with the same mtime and the same
    size, and the signature is then identical across a change it must not hide.
    Once something is pending we are already committed to restarting, so the
    handful of ticks before it fires read the content outright and correctness
    costs one walk rather than an unstoppable restart into code nobody wrote.

    Then two gates. Edits must go QUIET (every further change pushes the
    deadline out) so a rebase that touches forty files restarts once, and the
    server must be idle, so the restart never kills a compile the viewer is
    proxying for the browser.

HOW IT RESTARTS
    On the SAME PORT, always — that is what keeps the URL in the browser, and
    Vite's dev proxy target, valid across the restart. ``restart_argv`` rewrites
    only the binding flags.
