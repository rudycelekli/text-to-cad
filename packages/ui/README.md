# @text-to-cad/ui

The shared React interface for text-to-cad. `FileViewer` is the complete file tab:
its navbar, menus, content, the file explorer that floats over it, the column a
file's own panels open in, loading and error states, and common edit/save/reload
lifecycle. `CadViewer` (`@text-to-cad/ui/cad-viewer`) is the CAD viewer every app
shows: FileViewer over one root's CAD catalog, with the six CAD renderers, the
home (the model library) and the standard loading and missing-file pages.
`apps/web` and `apps/mcp` consume both through the package's compiled exports; a
host's own project, session and window layout remains application code.

The viewer's tools, tool stack, settings, tooltips and keyboard follow one
binding [design system](docs/settings-ui.md), the same in both apps. A change to
that chrome changes the design system first. Desktop's surrounding app controls
remain local where their appearance differs.

## Ownership and dependencies

UI may import `@text-to-cad/core` and browser-safe React dependencies. It must not
import an application, Electron, Node services, desktop IPC schemas, app stores,
or `window.textToCad`. Hosts inject file access, capabilities, navigation,
persistence, appearance and CAD services. Importing a package starts no polling,
workers or host storage writes and changes neither document title nor theme.

Shared UI is platform-agnostic: components must not detect web versus desktop
to choose their behavior. Express environmental differences through injected
capabilities and app-supplied named slots. React, DOM, canvas and responsive
layout remain shared; operating-system details and app workflows belong to the
host. Follow [the feature-extension workflow](docs/viewer-host.md#adding-a-shared-feature)
when introducing a new integration.

The design system's default UI size is 13px (`text-ui` in
[src/styles/tokens.css](src/styles/tokens.css)); `text-sm` and `text-base`
resolve to that same size for shared and host controls. Hosts apply `text-ui`
to their body; FileViewer also sets it at its own boundary. Use this default
for ordinary interface text, navigation and tabs. Settings sheets retain their
explicit compact scale: 12px section headings, 11px labels and control values,
and 10px metadata (see [settings UI](docs/settings-ui.md)). Document headings
and code retain their content styles.
Dropdown, select-popup and context-menu primitives default to the same 11px
compact text (`text-tiny`, 16px line height), including checkbox/radio items
and submenus. Menu shortcuts use 10px metadata. These defaults belong to the
primitives, including desktop's app-level equivalents; consumers do not add
per-menu font-size overrides. Portals set their own compact text size rather
than inheriting the trigger or host body's size.
Viewer hover hints use `TooltipHint` from the shared tooltip primitive, with
11px text and a 400ms delay. Use short action names, omit redundant hints on
obvious or already labeled controls, and show full tree/field names only when
clipped. Native HTML `title` attributes are not used for interface tooltips.

The token uses rems so desktop UI scaling still works without changing the
normal 16px root or shrinking layout spacing.

File-tab chrome uses normal-weight type. The navbar's file name, file and model rows,
and filter matches use muted/primary text color for emphasis, never bold weight. Tree
rows — files, model features, robot links — are 12px, the size of the section
titles and the filter above them.
Both tree lists inset row backgrounds 4px from their horizontal edges, including
selected, hovered and filtered rows; nesting adds indentation inside that gutter.
The file explorer (the host's file tree) floats over the view's LEFT, inset 8px
from its edges like the tool strip, on a solid background above the tools; it never
resizes the view or moves its tools. It is 220px by default, 140px at least and
480px at most; a drag of its right edge past the minimum stops at it, and only a
drag below half of it closes it. Below 720px of total FileViewer width it is a
dismissible floating sheet. The sheets have no extra visible title row and never
scroll or translate the host page. A CAD file's controls are not a panel of the
explorer but of the viewer's own tool stack under the toolbar: one width for every
panel until a person sizes one, bounded by the viewer's height.
Progress indicators use this same breakpoint. Panels never
scroll sideways: a Position panel's labels truncate to preserve its sliders and
inputs.

React, ReactDOM, Three.js and Lucide are host-supplied peers. React 18 and 19
are supported: web and desktop use React 19.3.0. Each
host must resolve one copy of each peer in its browser bundle. Web uses Vite
deduplication so shared imports use its host React and Lucide versions;
these peers are not bundled into UI.

`FileViewer` has no concrete renderer imports. A registration describes matching,
priority, panels, asynchronous preparation, lazy component loading and disposal.
Each app registers only the file types its source supports. A renderer's code
loads when a file selects it; adding a renderer does not add a branch to FileViewer.
The registry rejects duplicate IDs and ambiguous matches.

This package ships the viewer renderers. A renderer only one app registers is
that app's own, built on the same public `defineFileRenderer` contract (see
[renderers](docs/renderers.md)).

File listing is independent of renderer matching: the tree shows every entry
the host's source returns. A host that exposes arbitrary files registers a
fallback renderer (`fallback: true`) for the types nothing else matches.

```tsx
import { FileViewer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/file-viewer';
import { createStepRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/step';
import { createDxfRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/dxf';
import { createPlotRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/plot';
import { createGlbRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/glb';
import { createMeshRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/mesh';
import { createRobotRenderer } from '@text-to-cad/ui/renderers/robot';
import '@text-to-cad/ui/tokens.css';
import '@text-to-cad/ui/styles.css';

// One viewer renderer per file family, sharing one client and one preference source.
const renderers = [createStepRenderer({ client, preferences }), createDxfRenderer({ client, preferences }),
  createPlotRenderer({ client, preferences }), createGlbRenderer({ client, preferences }),
  createMeshRenderer({ client, preferences }), createRobotRenderer({ client, preferences })];
// The host supplies storage, actions, navigation and environmental ports.
<FileViewer file={selectedFile} host={host} renderers={renderers}
  state={state} onStateChange={setState} />;
```

Public entry points include `/host`, `/file-viewer`, `/tab-store`, `/navigation`, `/renderers/step`,
`/renderers/dxf`, `/renderers/plot`, `/renderers/glb`, `/renderers/mesh`, `/renderers/robot`, `/renderers/workspace`, `/file-viewer/presentation`, `/file-viewer/empty`,
`/cad-viewer`, `/catalog`, `/links`, `/library`, `/consent` (the analytics card and its state), `/features` (Settings' Features: `useFeatures`), `/drawing`, `/loading-icon`, `/utils`, `/primitives/*`,
`/tokens.css`, and `/styles.css`. `/catalog` (a CAD catalog as a `FileSource`, the file menu's
copies and reveal, and the paths a root names a file by) and `/links` (the navbar's link
defaults) are pure modules, with no React, for a host's adapters and their unit tests.

A CAD host composes `CadViewer` rather than FileViewer and the renderers: it hands
over its root's client and file source, its ports, its tab store, the file on screen
and how to show another (`onShow`), and its library.

```tsx
import { CadViewer, createCatalogFileSource } from '@text-to-cad/ui/cad-viewer';

<CadViewer client={client} host={host} tabStore={tabStore} live={live} file={file}
  onShow={showFile} rootPath={rootPath} library={library} onThumbnail={keepPicture} />;
```
Declarations are owned here; apps need no ambient shims or aliases into this
source tree.

`/drawing` is a separate lazy entry point for the Excalidraw editor, for temporary
sketches, with no platform discovery or persistent storage. Desktop owns its temporary Drawing tabs,
in-memory scene retention and prompt delivery; the viewer's Draw tool mounts the
same editor as an overlay in both apps.
Read [drawing](docs/drawing.md) before extending this editor or reusing it for
viewer annotations.

The required host contract, typed prompt bundles, delivery receipts and host
chrome slots are documented in [viewer host](docs/viewer-host.md). Clipboard
and page reload implementations live in the apps. Shared UI performs no
raw transport, clipboard discovery, host storage or page-navigation effects.

## Lifetimes and state

`FileSource` describes storage only: stat/list/search, optional reads and optional
write/create/rename/duplicate/trash operations, and the optional name a copied
reference gives a file (`referencePath`, else its path under the root). Menus
derive storage capabilities from these methods and native/copy capabilities from
the separate `FileActions` port. Missing methods remain unavailable. A web catalog
source stays read-only; listing never filters entries by renderer support.

Writes return saved, conflict, cancelled or error outcomes; mutations return
committed receipts, cancellation or typed failures. The desktop validates the
expected content revision, serializes writes to the same path and atomically
replaces its contents. Aborting a caller after dispatch does not undo a committed
operation. Hosts reconcile committed receipts even after that caller unmounts;
shared document/navigation hooks discard its late UI response.

Source subscriptions distinguish content and metadata changes from added,
deleted and moved entries. Content changes reload a clean document or mark its
draft stale; metadata changes do not discard a draft. Renames carry drafts to
the new path and remap every expanded/cached descendant. Hosts reconcile other
open tabs too. Deletes prune descendant listings while dirty editors retain
an explicit stale draft. Successful saves preserve typing made during the write.

A source has a stable root identity independent of a server's ephemeral port.
File state is scoped by root, path and renderer. Changing source or file aborts
pending preparation, releases prepared assets, and discards stale async results.
A renderer owns its viewport and resources; the host owns its CAD client. Last
render-session disposal releases shared worker leases. One viewer cannot replace
another viewer's cache provider or camera state.

Completed STEP CPU working sets can outlive a viewport in the shared renderer's
bounded cache. They retain exact decoded component buffers and copy structural
metadata for each mount; scene objects, controls and pending work are not cached.
Reuse is scoped to root, resource-provider generation and file revision. See
[CAD resource lifetime](docs/cad-renderer.md) for cache bounds and invalidation.
The Features tree can reuse those accepted component identities for completed
recognition metadata after the runtime descriptor also matches, avoiding surface
requests on a warm reopen without retaining another copy of the geometry.

The host owns where state lives; the package owns what it is. Everything the
viewer keeps is one tab record (`@text-to-cad/ui/tab-store`: the tab's settings and
the view of the file on screen — its camera, Display settings and the renderer's own
slices), thrown out with the tab and kept across a reload. Leaving a file drops its
view (`CadViewer`), and an update of it keeps what still fits the new revision. The
web keeps it in `sessionStorage`, the desktop in its per-tab store; both hand `createTabStore` one
synchronous read/write adapter and take `FileViewer`'s state from it. The tool in
hand, the selection and measurements are never stored. Capabilities determine menus: a read-only web source cannot
acquire editing or native operations merely by rendering this component.

## Development and verification

From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npx --no-install playwright install chromium
npm run build:packages
npm run typecheck --workspace @text-to-cad/ui
npm test --workspace @text-to-cad/ui
npm run check:boundaries
```

`check:boundaries` also holds `src/renderers/kit` format-blind: it imports no renderer
and names no file format ([Kit](docs/cad-renderer.md#kit)).

Rebuild shared packages after editing them; hosts resolve `dist`, never `src`.
Install the npm Playwright browser even if Python's snapshot browser is already
installed; they may require different Chromium revisions. On Linux, add
`--with-deps` to the browser install command if its system libraries are absent.
The Node runner caps file concurrency at four so JSX transforms and Chromium
setup do not compete with one process per host CPU. The UI suite includes Node
helper tests, React component tests and real Chromium
integration tests for renderer preparation, saves/conflicts, root changes,
multiple instances, cancellation and disposal. App integration and packaged
runtime checks remain with their hosts, and so do the tests of a host's own
renderers. See [renderer contracts](docs/renderers.md) for what a host renderer
may rely on.

## CAD document updates

The STEP renderer consumes the artifact, its schema-9 `.step.json`
sidecar and immutable store views. Embedded animation, authored appearance and
kinematics travel in the sidecar; an adjacent `.step.js` is a retired input.
The scene uses progressive component loading and demand-driven exact surfaces.
The Model tree shares the file tree's row and filter primitives. Its visible expansion
controls viewport selection, exact topology and optional feature recognition;
collapsed parts do not trigger whole-assembly analysis, and neither does its
filter, which searches names without expanding anything. Contextual measurements
remain available in Render too. See [model tree and recognition](docs/cad-renderer.md#step-panels)
for selection, isolation, demand and cache ownership.

Feature detection stays client-side in this renderer, separate from cadgen
compilation, Python inspection and reference syntax. Both apps reuse its worker
and versioned, bounded memory cache; it adds no persistent store. Read
[feature detection](docs/feature-detection.md) before changing inference rules,
cache identity, cancellation or recognition limits.

A CAD file declares no panel of the navbar: its controls are `ToolPanel`s in the
tool stack, shown by the tool they belong to. Select shows Features (a robot's Links)
and, with a selection, the Reference; Position shows Position; Display and Draw show
their own panels; kept effects (Explode, Clip, Measure's results) follow. A panel
whose tool is not up stays mounted, hidden, so a tree keeps its scroll and expansion;
only what is on screen does background work. The tree's X closes it alone (Select stays
the tool, marked) until a press on Select brings it back; it starts closed for a single
part and on a phone, open for an assembly, until a person chooses.
The tree, the Reference and Position are each sized by their own bottom-right grip, Quick
Edit's. SDF metadata is a Select panel
too. Links is the description's link tree, with the Model tree's rows, filter
and Reference panel; see [robot links](docs/cad-renderer.md#robot-links). Which of
the host's panels a file opens with is the host's to apply
(`ViewerHost.navigation.openFile(path, { target, panel })`): a file picked in the
tree asks for the tree, so the tree stays up while a person walks it; any other open
gets nothing. No panel is saved in a file's record.
The binding [viewer design system](docs/settings-ui.md) defines tool lifecycle,
the tool stack, mobile layout, section density, keyboard scope, tooltips
and preview. RendererShell owns the top-left toolbar, Quick Edit at the top-right, the
bottom-left cube, and a 3D view's controls it draws into the navbar's right end
(`navbarSlot`): Display (its settings, a dropdown), then Preview, after the host's Settings
(the person's settings, the same popover as on the home, Feedback in it). Preview is
the shell's own mode, where routines play and the model orbits, and takes the whole
page, the navbar with it. Keep app-specific effects in the
[host contract](docs/viewer-host.md), not in renderer components.

One per-file settings store serves controls, live commands and persistence.
Presets use the canonical grouped schema; see [View presets](docs/render-mode.md).
Expensive changes use [staged viewport updates](docs/view-updates.md): controls
remain authoritative, preparation is replaceable, and captures await presentation.
The camera is part of the file's view: a refresh restores the one the file on screen
was left at, and opening a file — again after leaving it, too — fits it.

Authored material color, finish and opacity are read-only in every style. There
is no Materials editor or persisted material override. See [View styles](docs/render-mode.md) and
[progressive detail](docs/lod.md).

The navbar names the file and offers its ⋯ menu, and Settings, whose Feedback opens a
new issue titled "Feedback: " where the host has a tracker; a renderer's loading and update status is its
own, in its viewport. An error appears as a card over the viewport; a failed update the
model survives can be dismissed, leaving the previous version to inspect, and the card's own
icon, the leftmost of the navbar's right-hand controls while it is put away, brings it back.
Retry reloads only the selected renderer; Report Issue, where the host has a tracker, opens a
new issue titled "Issue: ", labelled `bug`, filled in from the card, with the file's name and
no path of the machine.
