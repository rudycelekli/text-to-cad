/**
 * The tab record: everything the viewer keeps, kept for one tab and thrown out with it.
 *
 *   { version, settings, files }
 *
 * `settings` is tab-wide — the file tree's width and expansion (by root), the tool stack's
 * layout, the appearance and how the home lays out its library — and replaces every global
 * preference. `files` is the view of the file on screen (`kit/shell/fileView.js`: its camera,
 * its Display settings, its playback, its renderer's own slices) under `[root id, file path,
 * renderer id]`, and nothing else: a write puts a file last and drops any other
 * (`TAB_FILE_LIMIT`), and a host leaving a file drops its view (`files.retain`, which
 * `CadViewer` calls), so a reload brings back the file on screen and a file left starts over.
 *
 * This module is the record's one definition: its shape, its version and its normalization.
 * Reading is forgiving — a record another version wrote is the defaults, a field that is not
 * what it should be is its default — and writing is exact. A new kind of tab-wide state is one
 * more field of `settings` here; a new kind of per-file state is one more slice a renderer
 * hands the shell. Nothing here touches storage: a host supplies that (`tabStore.ts`).
