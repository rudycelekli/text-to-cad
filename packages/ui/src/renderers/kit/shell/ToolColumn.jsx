/**
 * The tool strip at a view's top-left corner and the tool stack under it, in one column inset from
 * the viewer's top and left edges and stopping above the cube and its actions in the bottom-left
 * corner: the column is exactly the height the stack may take, so however many panels are up, it
 * never runs past the viewer or under the cube (`ToolPanel.jsx` decides which of them gives way).
 * The 3D views (`RendererShell.jsx`) and the flat ones (a KiCad board's or schematic's) draw the same column.
 *
 * Every tool's panel but Select's has an X that puts the tool down. Select's tree has an X of its
 * own that closes the tree alone: the tool it belongs to then carries the strip's corner mark, and
 * a press on that tool while it is up opens the tree again; from another tool, a press only takes
 * it up, the tree still closed. Until the person has closed or opened it, the tree starts as the
 * tool says this file starts it (`panel.startsClosed`) and closed on a phone.
 *
 * @param {{ tools: import("../tools/FloatingToolBar.js").ViewportTool[], layout: object,
 *   onLayoutChange(patch: object | ((layout: object) => object)): void, mobile?: boolean, hidden?: boolean,
 *   invisible?: boolean, children?: import("react").ReactNode }} props
 *   `layout`: the tab's tool stack (`CadPreferences.toolStack`). `hidden`: the stack is put away (preview).
 *   `invisible`: the file explorer floats over this corner; the column steps out of sight under it, kept as it is.
