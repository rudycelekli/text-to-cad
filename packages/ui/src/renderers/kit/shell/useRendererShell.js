/**
 * Everything a file-family renderer needs from its host that is not about its
 * scene. The renderer loads its document and builds its scene; this hook owns
 * the rest and hands back one `shell` object for `<RendererShell>`:
 *
 *  - the file's view through the host (`state` / `onStateChange`, `fileView.js`): the
 *    camera, the Display settings, preview's playback settings, and the renderer's own
 *    slices of view state — written soon after a change and once more on unmount, and
 *    read back before the first paint, the camera restored in place of the open-time fit;
 *  - Display settings: store, resolution against the renderer's FEATURES, the
 *    queued application to the viewport, and the content of Display's dropdown;
 *  - tools: the mode state machine and Draw's session, or none at all for a
 *    renderer whose viewport is the camera's alone;
 *  - the host contract: prompt snapshots, clipboard screenshots,
 *    preview, alerts, shortcuts (a file's controls are tool-stack panels the renderer
 *    shows with its tools, never a host panel);
 *  - the live command surface, with the renderer's added and declined commands.
 *
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {import("../../../file-viewer/types.js").RendererViewProps} options.view  The host's props, unchanged.
 * @param {{ preferences: { toolStack: object }, onPreferenceChange(patch: object): void, live?: object,
 *   captureRequest?: { key: string | number } | null,
 *   acknowledgeCommand?: (kind: string, key: string | number) => void }} options.services  `preferences` is the
 *   tab's settings (`@text-to-cad/ui/tab-store`), the person's in every file of the tab.
 * @param {import("@text-to-cad/core/prompt").ResourceRef} options.resource  The document on screen, for prompt context and live state.
 * @param {string} options.modelKey  Stable per file: scopes the camera and the presentation.
 * @param {string} [options.revisionKey]  Changes when the file's bytes do.
 * @param {import("@text-to-cad/core/common/viewSettings.js").ViewFeatures} options.features
 * @param {object} [options.viewSettings]  The result of `useViewSettings`, when the renderer needs the
 *   display settings earlier in its own render than this hook could hand them back. It may also carry
 *   `applied`: the renderer's own `useAppliedViewSettings` result, for a renderer that must read the
 *   RESOLVED view that early too — a renderer that decides what to load, and at what detail, from the
 *   view it is showing. Such a renderer owns the viewport's handle as well and passes it as `viewerRef`.
 * @param {{ current: object | null }} [options.viewerRef]  The ref the viewport's handle lands in, when
 *   the renderer made it itself (see `viewSettings.applied`).
 * @param {ReturnType<typeof import("../tools/toolModes.js").createToolModes> | null} [options.toolModes]  Omitted
 *   by a renderer with no tools: the shell then has no active tool and a saved tab records none.
 * @param {boolean} [options.previewable]  The renderer's view is 3D and offers Preview: the model fullscreen,
 *   orbiting, its tools put away. Each renderer of a 3D view declares it; without it (a 2D view) there is no
 *   Preview at all — no control in the navbar, not a disabled one — and anything that asks for Preview leaves
 *   the normal view on screen (`previewing` stays false, `setPreviewing` does nothing).
 * @param {{ previewing: boolean, set: (previewing: boolean) => void }} [options.preview]  Preview mode
 *   (`usePreviewState`), when the renderer holds that state itself: a renderer whose own gates
 *   (picking, recognition, tool effects) run before this hook cannot wait for it. Every gate reads this one
 *   state; the Preview button, Escape and its X write it. Omitted: the shell holds it.
 * @param {{ mode: string, set: (update: (current: string) => string) => void }} [options.tool]  The tool in
 *   hand, when the renderer holds that state itself: a renderer whose LOAD, or what Escape means in it,
 *   turns on which tool is up cannot wait for this hook to hand it back. The rules stay the shell's —
 *   `set` is given the mode `toolModes` decided. Omitted: the shell holds the state.
 * @param {import("../scene.js").KitScene | null} options.scene
 * @param {{ busy: boolean, updating?: boolean, progress?: object | null, alert?: object | null,
 *   editPending?: boolean, finding?: boolean }} options.load  The
 *   renderer's document load. `busy`: nothing to show yet. `updating`: a newer revision is loading behind the scene on
 *   screen. The rest are for a renderer whose document is more than a download — see `loadReport.js`.
 * @param {object | null} [options.animation]  A playbar runtime (with its own `clock`), when the file has
 *   routines. Routines play in preview alone: the shell then puts them in its Playback settings and the
 *   playbar under the model, and leaving preview hands the runtime's `onRelease` the model back at rest.
 * @param {{ commands?: Record<string, (...args: any[]) => void>, declined?: Record<string, string>,
 *   state?: () => object, resource?: () => object }} [options.live]  Live commands this renderer adds (by name) or
 *   declines (name to the error its caller reads), and extra fields for the live state. Every name in
 *   `HOST_LIVE_COMMANDS` must be one or the other. `resource` is the document the viewport is SHOWING, when that
 *   can lag the one being loaded (a rebuild whose predecessor is retained): live state reports what is on screen,
 *   never what is on its way in. Omitted: the resource the renderer was handed.
 * @param {() => import("@text-to-cad/core/prompt").PromptReference[]} [options.promptReferences]  What a snapshot
 *   depicts, when that is narrower than the whole file (a selection). Default: the file.
 * @param {(input: { resource: object, references: object[], capture: Promise<Blob> }) => object} [options.promptContext]
 *   How this renderer assembles a snapshot's prompt context. Default `createViewPromptContext`, which takes
 *   references already in the prompt grammar; a renderer with a reference vocabulary of its own supplies the
 *   builder that speaks it, and then `promptReferences` may return that vocabulary instead — and such a
 *   renderer reports its live `selection` itself, in the prompt grammar, through `live.state`.
 * @param {{ active?: boolean, handle?: () => boolean }} [options.escape]  Escape, innermost first: `handle` returns
 *   true when it spent the key. After it there is nothing of the viewer's own left to close: the
 *   host's panel column (the file tree) closes only from its own toggle.
 * @param {{ signatures?: Record<string, string>, read: () => Record<string, unknown> } | null} [options.rendererState]
 *   The renderer's own slices of the file's view (`fileView.js`): `read()` is called when the view is written,
 *   never at render — state a renderer keeps outside React (a pose written per frame) is saved as it is at that
 *   moment, its last change before unmount included — and `signatures` says, per slice, what it is written
 *   against; a slice comes back (`readFileView`, which the renderer calls itself on mount) only under the same
 *   signature. The renderer calls `shell.scheduleStateSave()` when a slice changed. Null, or omitted, keeps
 *   what is stored as it is: a renderer that has not loaded yet, or one with no slices of its own.
 * @param {() => void} [options.onCameraSettled]  The camera came to rest on a new view: it moved and was
 *   recorded, a preview camera moved (preview mode, which records nothing), or the viewport's size
 *   changed — which can expose part of a scene without changing position, target or zoom at all. For a
 *   renderer that samples the camera to decide what detail its scene needs. It is called often; debounce
 *   it if that matters.
 * @param {boolean} [options.preserveInteractionPixelRatio]  The scene is drawn with hairlines just now: keep the
 *   idle pixel ratio while the camera moves, instead of dropping it for the duration of the gesture.
 * @param {{ onRelease?(runtime: object, detail: { handoff: boolean }): void, onContextLost?(): void,
 *   onInitializationError?(error: unknown): void }} [options.runtimeLifecycle]  What happens to the WebGL runtime
 *   under the scene, for a renderer that hangs its own objects or in-flight work on it (`ShellViewport.jsx`).
 * @param {(alert: object | null) => void} [options.onRuntimeAlert]  The viewport reported an alert, or
 *   cleared one. A renderer that folds the viewport's alert into an alert of its own keeps that state
 *   itself and hands the composed result back as `load.alert`; the shell then holds none of its own.
 *   Omitted: the shell keeps it and folds it into the report.
 * @param {ReturnType<typeof usePresentationReport>} [options.presentationReport]  What the viewport is
 *   previewing, when the renderer holds that state itself: a renderer that must answer "is what is on screen
 *   the document I asked for" before this hook runs — a live preview deciding whether its own result has
 *   landed (`presentationIsPending` with `shellPresentationKey(modelKey, revisionKey)`). Omitted: the shell holds it.
 * @param {string} [options.sceneScaleMode]
