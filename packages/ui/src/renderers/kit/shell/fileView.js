// A file's view: the one record the host keeps for the file on screen in its tab, under
// `[root, file path, renderer id]` (`@text-to-cad/ui/tab-store`), until the tab leaves the file.
// One flat, versioned object:
//
//   { version: 2, camera, display, playback, renderer }
//
//   camera    the renderer's own camera value, opaque here: a perspective snapshot for a scene
//             (`readShellCamera`), a plane transform for a drawing. Null is "fit the model".
//   display   the Display settings, every section of them.
//   playback  preview's Playback settings (`tools/playbar/playbackPreferences.js`): orbit on or
//             off and its speed, Autoplay, and the speed and loop chosen for the routine.
//   renderer  the renderer's own slices of view state, each `{ signature, value }`: what the
//             slice was written against. A slice comes back only while its signature still
//             matches the one the renderer declares for the file on screen — a rebuilt model
//             has different parts, so ids from the old one are not ids at all — while the
//             camera and the display are always kept.
//
// Reading is forgiving (a record another version wrote, or a slice that no longer fits, is
// simply not restored); writing is exact. Nothing here touches storage: the host owns that.
// What the view never holds: the tool in hand, a selection, measurements, ink, preview, a
// routine's time — every open starts those afresh.
