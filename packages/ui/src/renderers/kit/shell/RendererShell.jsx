/**
 * The frame every file-family renderer draws itself in: the viewport box with the tool strip at
 * its top-left corner and the tool stack under it, Quick Edit at the top-right, the cube in the
 * bottom-left corner, the view's controls in the navbar's right end (Display settings and
 * Preview, in the renderer's `navbarSlot`), the loading, update and alert overlays, and preview
 * mode's controls. The same
 * structure, classes and data attributes for every renderer: hosts, stylesheets and tests key on
 * them. A file's controls are never a sidebar: they are panels in the tool stack, shown by the
 * tool they belong to. Nothing sits at the bottom centre but preview's playbar.
 *
 * @param {{ shell: ReturnType<typeof import("./useRendererShell.js").useRendererShell>,
 *   tools: import("../tools/FloatingToolBar.js").ViewportTool[],
 *   toolPanels?: import("react").ReactNode,
 *   playback?: any,
 *   references?: readonly import("@text-to-cad/core/prompt").PromptReference[],
 *   copySelection?: (() => unknown) | null,
 *   contextMenuItems?: ((press: { clientX: number, clientY: number, shiftKey: boolean }) => object[] | null) | null,
 *   onContextMenuOpenChange?: ((open: boolean) => void) | null,

 *     mountRef: object, viewerReadyTick: number, commitScene: () => boolean }) => import("react").ReactNode) }} props
 *   `tools`: left to right, from `shell.tools`; an EMPTY list draws no strip at all,
 *   which is what a file whose viewport only orbits, pans and zooms hands over. A tool the
 *   file cannot offer is left out, never handed over disabled. A tool that names a `closable`
 *   panel of its own (`panel: { id, label, startsClosed }`: Select's tree, which a single part
 *   opens with closed) is marked while that panel is closed, and a press on it while it is up
 *   opens the panel again.
 *   `toolPanels`: the tool stack's panels, top to bottom — each a `ToolPanel`
 *   (`kit/tools/ToolPanel.jsx`), shown or `hidden` by the renderer as its tools say: what
 *   the tool in hand shows (Select's tree and Reference, Position's joints), then the
 *   effects a person keeps. The stack is one column the viewer's height, gone in preview.
 *   `playback`: the playbar runtime, when the renderer hands the shell one of its own rather
 *   than through `useRendererShell`'s `animation`. Routines play in preview alone.
 *   `references`: what is selected, in the prompt grammar — the references a Quick Edit attaches
 *   (`kit/tools/quick-edit/QuickEdit.jsx`), counted in its header; the file itself always goes. A
 *   renderer that hands none has no Quick Edit: only a view whose picks and sketches a note can
 *   carry offers one. The box sizes itself, for as long as it is open: a drag of its corner renders nothing
 *   here. `onClearReferences`: the renderer's clear of that selection, as a press on the
 *   background makes it; Quick Edit's X calls it, and clears Draw's ink too.
 *   `copySelection`: the viewer's copy key (⌘C / Ctrl+C) while the renderer's own tool is up and
 *   something is selected (Draw's copies the view with its ink); null when there is nothing to copy.
 *   `contextMenuItems`: what THIS renderer offers on a secondary tap over the canvas; the
 *   gesture, the anchor and the dismissal are the shell's (`ViewportContextMenu.jsx`), and a
 *   renderer that passes none has no viewport menu at all. `onContextMenuOpenChange(open)`
 *   says while that menu is up, for a renderer that marks what the menu is about.
 *   `viewportOverlay`: the renderer's own layer over the canvas; as a function it is given
 *   the viewport, which is five things: its live runtime, the element its pointer events
 *   arrive on, the element the canvas is mounted in, a tick that changes when the runtime is
 *   replaced, and `commitScene()` for a scene that changed IN PLACE. A handle overlay or a
 *   pointer pick (`kit/tools/select/usePointerPick.js`) reads the first, second and fourth;
 *   a renderer that draws its own canvas over the model or publishes a scene progressively
 *   needs the other two.
 *   `frameProvider`: the renderer wraps the WHOLE frame — its own context, above the tool
 *   stack as well as the viewport, because both read it. It is given the frame and returns
 *   it wrapped; a renderer that passes none is mounted exactly as it is.
 *   `onCanvasPointerDown`: a press that landed on the canvas, before anything in the viewport sees
 *   it. The frame focuses itself on such a press whatever the renderer does; this is for a renderer
 *   that also has something to put down when the person reaches for the model.
