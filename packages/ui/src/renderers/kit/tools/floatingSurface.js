/**
 * The surfaces of everything that floats over the model, defined here once so they cannot drift
 * apart; a caller adds layout, never a surface of its own. Both are translucent and blurred, so the
 * model reads through without the text losing to it, with a border that keeps the edge on a light
 * scene and a dark one alike.
 *
 * `FLOATING_SURFACE_CLASS`: the popovers and menus opened over the viewport (a mode menu, the
 * viewport's context menu, Display's settings, preview's Playback settings) — small, read while they are
 * up, and opaque enough that their text never competes with the model.
 * `FLOATING_CHROME_SURFACE_CLASS`: the tool strip and each panel of the tool stack, which stay up
 * beside the model for as long as a file is open: the background at 45.5%, light enough, and barely
 * blurred, that the model behind them is easy to make out, with the same border. A view whose
 * picture keeps its own colours against the theme (a KiCad schematic's light paper under the dark
 * theme, a board's dark one under the light) raises it with `--cad-chrome-alpha` on an ancestor,
 * or the panels would turn the picture's grey and their muted text would vanish into it.
