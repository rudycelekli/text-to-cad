//
// A STEP does not arrive once. A large assembly is published in pieces, each
// component's detail is swapped as the camera moves, and a display mode that changes
// how records are BUILT replaces the whole build. None of that is a new scene to the
// viewport: the roots below never change, so the viewport adopts this object once
// and is told (`viewport.commitScene()`) when what is inside it changed. Re-adopting
// a fresh identity per publish would re-dress every material and re-walk every mesh
// six times while a big model opens.
//
// Ownership. The build (`cadScene`) owns its records, materials and the geometries it
// created. Component geometry is SHARED between builds and between scenes through
// core's owner counts (`syncRecordGeometryOwnership`), so releasing a build drops this
// scene's count and frees a buffer only when no other build holds it; `releaseGpu:
// false` keeps the GPU buffers and BVHs for a rebuild of the same model. Nothing here
// disposes a geometry directly.
