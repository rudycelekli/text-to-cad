/**
 * The rasters a plot pane paints from: what keeps a zoom crisp and a pan cheap.
 *
 * A sheet's SVG is drawn by the browser, which rasterises the vector at whatever scale it lands
 * at — crisp at any zoom, and far too slow to do every frame: a large board's plot is tens of
 * megabytes of SVG and a second to rasterise. So the pane draws the SVGs into a PATCH — a canvas
 * covering what the pane shows plus a margin, at exactly the scale it is shown at, made with
 * core's `drawPlot` and the sheets' own images (`sheetImages`), the frame a snapshot draws — and
 * every frame is the sheets' backgrounds and the patches over them, placed in page space
 * (`drawPlot` again). A pan moves a patch by whole device pixels: a blit, never a resample. A
 * zoom scales the patches it has until the view has been still for `SETTLE_MS`; then the view is
 * drawn again at its new scale. A pan past the margin is the same: what is not covered shows the
 * sheet's background until the view rests, then it is drawn.
 *
 * A few patches are kept (`PATCH_LIMIT`, and `PATCH_BUDGET_PIXELS` between them), least recently
 * drawn first out: zooming back out to a view drawn before is instant, and a zoom or a pan has
 * something under it. The one at the scale on screen is drawn last, over the others.
 *
 * Nothing here is React: the pane's view hook owns one of these per plot, paints through it and
 * disposes of it with the plot.
