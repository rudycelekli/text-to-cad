/**
 * The canvas a plot is painted on: the kit's flat-picture view (`kit/plane/usePlaneView.js` —
 * drag to pan, wheel or pinch to zoom about the pointer, double-click to fit), painting the
 * plot's sheets from the rasters kept of them (`plotRasters.js`) on the theme's background.
 *
 * Each sheet is drawn on its own background, the one its tool draws it on; only the surround is
 * the theme's, so a theme flip repaints the surround and redraws nothing.
 *
 * The pane says whether what it shows is final — drawn at the scale it is shown at — as
 * `data-plot-settled` on its element, written as it paints (no render): a zoom is `false` until
 * the view has rested and been drawn again.
