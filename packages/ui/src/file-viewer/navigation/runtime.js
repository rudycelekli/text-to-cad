/**
 * `@text-to-cad/ui/navigation` — the chrome AROUND a file surface, shared by every
 * app that draws one.
 *
 * A renderer draws one file's contents; this is everything else a person sees:
 * the navbar above it (the home mark, the explorer's toggle, the open file's
 * name and its menu, the host's links), the file explorer that floats over the
 * view's left, the menus a row and the navbar drop down, the column a file's
 * own declared panels open in, and the empty state when nothing is open. Every
 * app imports from here, so those are the same code and not merely the same
 * design. What differs is injected: what a host can DO with a file, which is a
 * capability set rather than a fork, where its links point, and its home.
 *
 * The dependency runs one way — the apps depend on this package and this
 * package depends on nothing of theirs — which is why the things the hosts
 * genuinely differ on, where a directory listing comes from and what an entry
 * menu's items do, are injected as source adapters rather than imported.
