# Render types: capabilities and the backend contract

Binding for viewer work that touches more than one file format. The rule this document
exists to enforce:

> Viewer code asks what a format **can do**, never what it **is**.

Every `renderFormat === RENDER_FORMAT.X` check is a place a new format must be
hand-added, and a place an improvement to one format fails to reach the others. That is
not theoretical. The Orbit button was gated off per format independently and had to be
fixed twice; when it was finally enabled for DXF, the button still did nothing because
**four** separate format checks stood between it and preview mode (the toolbar gate, the
workspace handler bail, the pane's `previewMode={dxfMode ? false : ...}`, and an effect
that force-exited DXF from preview). Another format grew an entire parallel export path to
an endpoint the server does not implement.

## Scope

This is the rule inside the STEP renderer (`src/renderers/step`). A DXF, a KiCad board
or schematic, a wiring harness, a GLB, a triangle mesh (STL, 3MF) and a robot description (URDF, SRDF, SDF)
have renderers of their own (`src/renderers/dxf`, `src/renderers/plot`, `src/renderers/glb`,
`src/renderers/mesh`, `src/renderers/robot`; see [CAD renderer](cad-renderer.md#kit)): a
vertical slice owns its tools, tabs and scene outright and consults no capability table.
The `dxf`, `kicad_pcb`, `kicad_sch`, `harness`, `glb`, `stl`, `3mf`, `urdf`, `srdf` and `sdf` rows below
remain for what is not a renderer: the file list's icon and label. The headless snapshot renderer consults no table either: it draws
each of those families with the scene builder its renderer uses
([one scene builder per family](cad-renderer.md#one-scene-builder-per-family-the-viewer-and-the-snapshot-cli)).

The DXF slice does not even have a scene: it is a canvas painted from
`GET /__cad/drawing`, so none of the viewport capabilities below describes it — and its
row says so, with `assetKind: drawing` and no tools. `cadgen dxf snapshot` paints the same
payload with the same code (`@text-to-cad/core/lib/drawing2d`), so the CLI cannot produce a
picture the pane could not. A KiCad board or schematic, and a wiring harness, are the same
kind of row, with `assetKind: plot`: a canvas painted from `GET /__cad/plot` (KiCad's SVG
plot, WireViz's diagram), and `cadgen pcb snapshot` and `cadgen harness snapshot` draw it
with the same `@text-to-cad/core/lib/plot2d`.

## The capability registry

`packages/core/src/lib/renderCapabilities.js` — one frozen table, keyed by render
format. Pure data: no behaviour, no imports beyond the format enum.

| Capability | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `assetKind` | Which asset a format LOADS: `mesh`, `drawing`, `robot`. |
| `iconKind` | The file-list glyph. |
| `tools` | `select`, `pan`, `draw`, `orbit`, `screenshot`. Orbit and screenshot are true for every format WITH a viewport — they act on the viewport, not the geometry. `dxf`, `kicad_pcb`, `kicad_sch` and `harness` claim none of them here: their pane is a canvas, and a board's own tools (Select, Draw, Measure) and a schematic's (Select) belong to the plot renderer (`renderers/plot/board`), which consults no table. |
| `parts` | Per-part selection, hiding, isolate, assembly tree. |
| `topology` | Face/edge/vertex references. Implies `parts`. |
| `exploded`, `displayModes`, `clip` | STEP-tier display transforms. |
| `params` | `sidecar` (the model's `@step(pose=...)` block), or `null`. |
| `animations` | Has animation clips, so transport controls apply. |
| `artifactManaged` | Builds a package before it can render. A format listed here that the backend cannot produce a package for blocks forever, so a format the viewer renders from its own file belongs out. |

### Rules

- Add a capability when the **second** format needs it, never speculatively.
- An unknown format resolves to the conservative default row (everything optional off).
  Deliberately *not* `normalizeRenderFormat`, which resolves unknowns to STEP and would
  hand an unrecognised entry STEP's full capability set.
- Capabilities decide **which** panels and tools mount. Format-specific *content* — STEP's
  tree — stays format-specific.

## The content signal

`selectedViewportContent` in the STEP renderer is the single answer to "is there anything on
screen?", its loaded mesh data. Toolbar gates, the CTA, preview mode, the viewport
context menu and alert blocking all read it, rather than each one re-deriving the answer
per format.

## The render-backend contract

The kit's viewport (`renderers/kit/shell/ShellViewport.jsx`) is the shell and owns the camera,
`OrbitControls`, the scene stage, frame presentation, the Draw overlay, screenshots and the
imperative viewer API. A renderer's **scene** (the contract `renderers/kit/scene.js` re-exports from core; STEP's is
`renderers/step/scene/stepScene.js`) owns geometry only:

1. **Consume content**: the document its renderer loaded (a STEP's mesh data, a GLB's native
   scene, a mesh file's objects, a robot's parts). A GLB's, a mesh's and a robot's scene is
   built in `@text-to-cad/core`, where the snapshot CLI builds the same one.
2. **Publish bounds** so the shared fit and its zoom baseline work. The mesh
   path does this via `applyRuntimeModelBounds` after composing; a backend with no mesh
   calls back with its own bounds instead.
3. **Optionally install loop-tuning hooks** on the runtime. All are inert unless set, so
   the mesh path is unaffected:
   - `renderOnDemandOnly` — do not hold the render loop open for a whole gesture.
   - `idleQualityDelayMs` — raise the idle-restore delay.
   - `onIdleQualityRestore` — restore quality before the pixel ratio, so the expensive
     frame and the drawing-buffer reallocation do not land on the same vsync.
   - `resolveExtraPixelRatioCap` — cap resolution below the shared caps.

A backend never reaches into the camera, controls or stage. If it needs something from
them, that is a shell feature and belongs in the shell where every format gets it.

### Adding a format

Declare a registry row, implement a backend, add a fixture to the sweep. Do not touch the
shell. If you find yourself adding a format check to `FloatingToolBar` or to anything under
`renderers/step/scene/`, the capability you need is missing from the table.

## Enforcement

A ratcheting policy test in the repo where this app is developed counts identity
checks in non-test client code: the number may only go down. It also asserts a
growing set of files at **zero** — the toolbar, every module of the STEP scene
(`renderers/step/scene/`), the alert
builder, the file-list icon and status, and the home screen — since those are the surfaces
every format flows through. Lower the budgets in the same commit that removes checks.

What is left is deliberate. `useCadAssets` is allowlisted: choosing and running a loader
per format is its whole job, and the `assetKind` field names *which* loader without
pretending the implementations are the same. `stepArtifactStatus.js` keeps its checks
because STEP package error codes, the `stale` flag and the renderable-GLB fallback are
STEP vocabulary. STEP is now the only artifact-managed format: a DXF is rendered from
the file that is on disk — the backend flattens those bytes to 2D primitives per request
and never owns a package for one (`owns_dxf_path` always answers False).

## Standing gate

The `web` CI job's `scripts/test/test-viewer-browser.sh` opens one fixture per load path
(STEP, STL, DXF, URDF) through the real backend and the bundled viewer and asserts each
draws something with no page errors: a blank-but-error-free viewport is the signature
failure here (a shader that fails to compile, a gate that hides the geometry). It runs on
every change to shared viewer code; there is no separate manual sweep.

## Known non-uniformities

Recorded so they are not mistaken for bugs, and so the next person knows the cost:


## Scene recipe conformance

Inspect and Render resolve through `@text-to-cad/core/common/sceneSettings.js`.
Inspect's fixed light/dark workbench basis follows app appearance; Render uses
its independent studio configuration. Legacy CAD theme preferences are not an
input. The internal `themeSettings` recipe remains a renderer implementation
detail, normalized through the shared core schema so every backend receives the
same lighting, materials and stage settings.

The browser qualification in `scripts/test/test-viewer-browser.sh` opens every
load path through the real backend and bundle and checks mode framing, that a saved
revision keeps the camera and that Zoom to fit frames the revision; picking and the
display presets are the `packages/ui` browser specs'. Both use
isolated generated fixtures rather than a sweep of saved theme presets.
