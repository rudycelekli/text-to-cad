# View presets and grouped settings

The CAD viewer and snapshots consume one grouped display contract. **Solid**,
**Render**, **X-ray**, **Hidden line**, and **Wireframe** are presets over that
contract, not separate lists of settings. `common/viewSettings.js` in core owns
normalization, defaults, group gates, Custom detection and Reset.
`common/sceneSettings.js` translates the resolved groups into the renderer recipe.

The binding control patterns are in [settings-ui.md](./settings-ui.md); host
injection and agent commands are in [viewer-host.md](./viewer-host.md). The shared
UI does not discover app storage, transport or desktop APIs.

## Viewer mode choices

| Preset | Surfaces / edges | Lighting, background, floor | Projection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solid (default) | Authored opaque shading / visible edges | Neutral workbench defaults | Orthographic |
| Render | Authored shading / edges off | Enabled | Perspective |
| X-ray | 22% surface opacity / all edges | Neutral workbench defaults | Orthographic |
| Hidden line | Depth-only surfaces / visible edges | Neutral workbench defaults | Orthographic |
| Wireframe | No surface fill / all edges | Neutral workbench defaults | Orthographic |

Render is option two. Grid and origin axes default on outside Render, off in
Render. All settings remain available in every preset. Changing a view value
shows **Custom**, retaining the selected preset as the reset target. Returning
all values to their preset values restores its name. Custom is derived, never
stored as a preset ID.
The dropdown shows Custom as a muted placeholder with no selected option.
Only presets appear in its list. Selecting the remembered base preset reapplies
its defaults.

## State and updates

`kit/view-settings/viewSettingsStore.js` owns one canonical, sparse display state per
mounted file. `useViewSettings` subscribes React to that store. UI controls and
live agent commands use the same explicit operations: `patch`, `setEnabled`,
`selectPreset`, `reset`. Session restoration uses `restore` once on mount;
persistence reads `getSnapshot().display`, including edits accepted before the
next React render. Never merge against a control's captured props, feed resolved
defaults back into the store, or maintain another display state alongside it.

The store derives the scene recipe and preserves equal JSON branches. The
viewport's render-state resolver preserves those identities through its internal
normalization. A Clip edit changes clipping only; it does not invalidate surface
materials, lighting, geometry or camera. No-op actions publish no update.
Projection/lens flow down as camera props and the viewport applies them once.
Camera pose remains viewport-owned, separate from preset settings.

Selecting a preset replaces visual overrides, including projection/lens. **Reset**
restores that selected preset and disables Clip/Explode. Selecting a preset
preserves those tools. Neither action changes camera viewpoint/zoom, selection,
visibility, the open panel or the model's pose.
Projection remains editable in every preset, including orthographic Render.

## Groups and enablement

| Group | Controls | Disabled behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camera | Projection in Mode; standard 50mm perspective lens | No UI gate |
| Surfaces | Shaded/flat/hidden/off, original/single/by-part colors, opacity | Always expanded; Off is an explicit surface style |
| Edges | Visible/all, color | No CAD edges |
| Lighting | Quality, exposure, rotation, softbox size, fill | Neutral CAD lighting/reflections |
| Background | Color and opacity | Natural light/dark workbench background |
| Floor | Lowest point/model origin, Matte/Glossy finish, color and opacity | No floor |
| Grid | Color and opacity | No grid |
| Axes | Color and opacity (same default color as Grid) | No origin axes |

Expanded means enabled. A disabled section is gray and collapsed. Clicking or
keyboard-activating its title/plus enables it. Only the minus disables it.
Hover changes styling only: moving the pointer, scrolling or closing a dropdown
must never change settings or turn a preset into Custom. Disabling removes
custom values in that group. Re-enabling starts from preset values.
This is feature state, not a separate accordion preference.

There is no redundant Floor checkbox or Background transparency toggle. Color
pickers include opacity, with an opaque checkerboard behind the color swatch:
0% is transparent, 100% opaque. The background's fractional alpha reaches the
actual canvas and PNG, not just the preview.

Display's first section, **Display**, holds Mode, the host's
Appearance and Projection; **Surfaces** follows; both are always open. Grid and
Axes are one gated section, **Grid / Axes**, over two independent groups. The
panel's order is Display, Surfaces, Edges, Grid / Axes, Lighting, Background,
Floor. Preset changes never reorder controls. Clip and Explode are not Display
sections: they are STEP toolbar tools with their own panels, and their settings
live in this same store (`clip`, `exploded`). A tool opens neutral — Explode at
0%, Clip at no cut — and an edit enables its group; removing the tool discards
its amount, offsets and Flip. Preset selection preserves Clip/Explode; Display
Reset disables both. See
[settings-ui.md](./settings-ui.md#tools-and-lifecycle) for their lifecycle.
The remaining optional effects use the same feature gate primitive. A surface
gate that just restores ordinary shading is not a meaningful disable action.
The Lens slider and Camera section are omitted: perspective uses the standard
50mm focal length. Focal length remains in the camera/display API for scripted
framing and snapshots, but is not a routine viewer control.

## Sparse public contract

```json
{
  "mode": "render",
  "appearance": "light",
  "camera": { "projection": "orthographic" },
  "lighting": { "enabled": false },
  "background": { "color": "#ffffff", "opacity": 0.4 },
  "floor": { "placement": "origin", "color": "#dddddd", "opacity": 0.8, "finish": "glossy" }
}
```

- Omitted mode is `solid`. Omitted groups inherit the selected preset.
- A partial group overrides only supplied properties and implicitly enables the
  group unless `enabled: false` is explicit. Empty `{}` enables preset values.
- `enabled: false` resolves to the group's neutral behavior regardless of stored
  values. The UI removes those values when disabling; a CLI payload may contain
  disabled values but they have no effect.
- `clip` and `exploded` remain tool groups outside Custom and preset selection.
  Display Reset disables them.
- Viewer appearance inherits its host; snapshots default to `light`.
  Explicit `appearance: "light" | "dark"` overrides that baseline.
- Interactive lighting defaults to Preview; snapshots to Final. Core takes this
  as an explicit context baseline, so omitted quality is not Custom. A supplied
  `lighting.quality` overrides the baseline.

The same shape powers live `setDisplaySettings` and snapshot `--display`.
`--display render` is shorthand for the Render preset. JSON or a JSON file can
supply partial grouped overrides. `--camera` contains pose/framing only;
projection and focal length belong to `display.camera`. No `--render`, nested
`display.render`, legacy `guides`/`partColor`, or old mode IDs are accepted at new
public command boundaries. Only saved file sessions migrate those old fields.

The renderer still has lower-level material/depth mode IDs internally. They are
implementation details derived from surfaces/edges; never persist them or expose
them as public display values.

## Rendering costs and camera behavior

The photographic rig stays lazy. Enabling Lighting creates the photographic
softbox environment; Floor or Background alone retain neutral lighting and do
not create a photographic environment. Authored materials are read-only. Color
overrides are presentation settings, not edits to the model or its material
assignments.

| Lighting quality | Screen error | Shadow map | Environment | Capture scale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preview | 1 px | 2048 px | 256 px | 1× |
| Final | 0.25 px | 4096 px | 512 px | 2× |

The interactive viewer retains one WebGL renderer, canvas and camera controls
across every preset and settings edit. It uses shadow-compatible conventional
depth throughout, fitting near/far planes to the current model, closeup records
and floor/grid planes on every frame; a perspective near plane stays at or beyond
1/256 of the orbit pivot's depth, so a closeup never trades depth resolution for
a near plane at the eye. The grid's bounds also fit the far plane;
it remains visible when Floor is off. Grid spacing is five cells across the
default model framing. The grid, the stage and the Render studio's floor are
SIZED from the model's rest placement for every renderer, STEP included: a pose, a
playing routine, or entering Render while the model is posed never rescales or
slides the ground; its height, the lighting and the shadow reach follow the model. Enabling photographic effects updates that live scene;
it never clears or covers the canvas with a loading screen. Only actual context
recovery replaces the renderer. Quality refines tessellation within the same
cache and memory budget. Picking/topology stays demand-driven in every preset.

Enabling Clip prepares its shader/cap variants before presentation. Moving an
enabled cut stays live. Explicit neutral boundaries
still avoid unnecessary caps. See [responsive View updates](view-updates.md)
for scheduling, resource caching, loading presentation and capture readiness.

Render's floor stands at the model's lowest point, at 60% opacity; Model origin (the
document's Z=0 plane) is a choice away and reads as Custom, as Glossy does. A floor
turned on in another preset starts at model origin. A snapshot's Render floor stands
where the viewer's does: both resolve it from the same preset (`RENDER_FLOOR_PLACEMENT`).
While Render's lighting is on it carries a studio's soft grounding shadow, as deep
as the floor is opaque: darkest where the model touches it, the key light's cast
shadow softening and fading away from the model. The viewer re-renders its
shadows, and re-bakes this one, only for a change that can alter them: never
while the camera alone moves, and never for a hover, a selection or any other
highlight, which leave every part casting as it did (a highlighted part keeps
its shadow). While a routine plays or a pose is dragged, the key's cast shadow on the
floor follows every frame and the contact darkening under the model at most every
100 ms; once the model stops, both are baked for its final pose. A floor at zero
opacity bakes nothing, and a viewer that renders in software, whose key casts no
shadow, draws no floor shadow.
Its finish is Matte, or Glossy: a glossier floor that also reflects the model, crisp
where the model meets it and softening and fading over the model's height, as a
polished studio floor shows a product, in either appearance. The reflection is a
second draw of the scene at half the canvas's resolution, before each frame the camera
or the model moved in (about 4 ms of render CPU a frame on a large assembly); a hover
or selection keeps the last one and catches up within 400 ms. A Matte floor allocates
none of it and draws nothing extra, and switching back to Matte releases it. With
Render's lighting off, or in software, a glossy floor reflects nothing.
Its double-sided surface uses its actual elevation during
camera depth fitting, avoiding the origin-placement near-plane gap. Its color
and opacity are independent of Background.
Light Render defaults to a pure white background and retains the slightly gray
floor (`#e7e7e5`); explicit background colors still override the preset.
External STEP pose and animation passes publish current placed bounds before
drawing, and so does the exploded view wherever it comes to rest (a slider move,
the end of its ease) and at most every 100 ms while it eases in or out. Depth and
lighting follow moving parts without changing camera framing or the floor's
footprint.

All presets share surface-under-cursor zoom, zero-pose framing and the fit
padding: 1.1 across, and 1.1 down on a square or narrower viewport, easing to
1.25 at 16:9 and wider (`interactiveFitPadding`), so a wide view leaves room
above and below the model. Preset changes do not refit, and neither does a
rebuild of the open file. Motion changes geometry, not what 100% means. A
changed camera clears current screen-space drawings; camera state republished
unchanged after a runtime replacement does not.

## Where the controls live

Display settings are a dropdown from the Display button in the navbar's right end
(the perspective box, between Settings and Preview: `kit/shell/DisplayPopover.jsx`),
present for every 3D file, never a panel of the tool stack or a sidebar panel. A
file's model tree, its Reference and Position are panels of the tool stack (see
[settings-ui.md](./settings-ui.md#the-tool-stack)); nothing in them is a display
setting.

Display and Preview, the view's controls in the navbar, are offered by a 3D view
alone, as its renderer declares to the shell (`useRendererShell`'s `previewable`):

| Renderer | Files | Display and Preview |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step` | STEP, STP | Yes |
| `glb` | GLB | Yes |
| `mesh` | STL, 3MF | Yes |
| `robot` | URDF, SRDF, SDF | Yes |
| `dxf` | DXF | No: a 2D drawing, on a surface of its own, without the shell |

A view without them has no Display or Preview control, not a disabled one, and a
request for Preview leaves its normal view as it is.
